# Developer Documentation

**Build on a platform designed for technical depth and architectural elegance.**

{% hint style="info" %}
**New to Taskade's API?** Start with our [authentication guide](../start/authentication.md) and make your first API request in minutes.
{% endhint %}

Taskade's API is built around operational transformation, real-time data synchronization, and a unified intelligence layer that powers everything from simple CRUD operations to complex AI-driven workflows. Whether you're building integrations, automating processes, or creating entirely new applications, the platform provides both high-level abstractions and low-level control.

## üöÄ Quick Start

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="First API Call" %}

### **[Quickstart Guide ‚Üí](../start/authentication.md)**

Set up your development environment, get API keys, and make your first request in under 5 minutes.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://www.taskade.com/api/v1/workspaces
```

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Authentication" %}

### **[Authentication Guide ‚Üí](../start/personal-tokens.md)**

Learn about API keys, OAuth, and security best practices for production applications.

**Supported methods:**

- Personal Access Tokens (recommended for development)
- OAuth 2.0 (recommended for production)
  {% endtab %}

## üõ†Ô∏è Core APIs

### **[Workspaces & Projects](api/workspaces/README.md)**

**Tree-structured data with operational transformation**. Projects are implemented as conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) enabling real-time collaboration without central coordination. Each project maintains a versioned DAG of changes with sub-second synchronization across clients.

### **[Tasks & Data](api/tasks/README.md)**

**Event-sourced task management with rich field types**. Tasks support complex data relationships, custom field schemas, and atomic batch operations. The system maintains audit trails and supports time-travel queries for debugging and analytics.

### **[AI Agents](api/agents/README.md)**

**Stateful AI agents with persistent memory and tool access**. Each agent maintains its own knowledge graph derived from project data, documents, and conversation history. Agents can be composed into multi-agent workflows with dependency resolution and error handling.

## ‚ö° Automations & Integrations

### **[Automation System](../automation/README.md)**

**Event-driven architecture with guaranteed delivery**. Built on a distributed event bus using Apache Kafka for reliable message processing. Supports exactly-once delivery semantics, dead letter queues, and automatic retry with exponential backoff.

### **[Triggers & Actions](../automation/triggers.md)**

**Reactive programming model with 99.9% uptime**. Triggers are implemented as lightweight watchers with microsecond-level change detection. Actions support circuit breakers, bulkheads, and timeout patterns for robust external service integration.

### **[Integration Reference](../automation/comprehensive-integrations.md)**

**100+ pre-built connectors with OpenAPI 3.0 compliance**. Each integration includes rate limiting, authentication handling, and automatic schema validation. Custom integrations support GraphQL subscriptions and WebSocket streaming.

## üéØ Genesis API

### **[Genesis API](api/genesis/README.md)**

**Multi-modal AI system with code generation and deployment pipeline**. Genesis combines GPT-5 and Claude-4 in a unified TAA (Taskade AI Assistant) architecture. The system performs AST-level code analysis, dependency resolution, and automated testing before deployment to Fly.io infrastructure.

### **[Space Apps & Deployment](api/genesis/README.md#space-apps)**

**Full-stack React applications with real-time data binding**. Generated apps include TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and automatic API client generation. Apps are deployed as serverless functions with edge caching and automatic scaling. Supports hot reloading and incremental builds.

## üìö Resources

### **[OpenAPI Specification](https://www.taskade.com/api/documentation/static/index.html#/)**

Interactive API documentation with live testing capabilities.

### **[SDKs & Libraries](api/README.md#sdks-and-tools)**

Official and community-maintained libraries for popular languages.

### **[API Best Practices](api/README.md#best-practices)**

**Performance characteristics and scaling guidelines**. The platform handles 100k+ requests/second with P95 latency under 50ms. Rate limits are enforced using token bucket algorithms with burst capacity. Includes guidance on connection pooling, request batching, and optimal retry strategies.

## üí° What You Can Build

### **Distributed Systems & Data Processing**

- **Real-time analytics pipelines** with sub-second latency using WebSocket streams
- **Multi-tenant SaaS platforms** with isolated data partitioning and row-level security
- **Event-sourced architectures** with automatic snapshots and replay capabilities
- **Microservice orchestration** with automated dependency injection and health monitoring

### **AI-Native Applications**

- **Multi-agent systems** with planning, execution, and feedback loops
- **Knowledge graphs** that evolve with user interactions and document ingestion
- **Semantic search engines** using vector embeddings and hybrid retrieval
- **Context-aware automation** that adapts behavior based on historical patterns

### **Infrastructure & DevOps**

- **GitOps workflows** with automatic deployment and rollback capabilities
- **Monitoring systems** with custom metrics, alerting, and anomaly detection
- **API gateways** with rate limiting, authentication, and request/response transformation
- **Data synchronization** between heterogeneous systems with conflict resolution
