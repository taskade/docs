## Understanding Roam Research Structure

### Roam Research Fundamentals

Roam Research organizes information using:

**Pages**: Main containers for topics and ideas
**Blocks**: Individual units of content that can be referenced and linked
**Bi-directional Links**: Connections between related concepts that update automatically
**Block References**: Dynamic references to blocks that update when source content changes
**Daily Notes**: Time-based note-taking with automatic linking

### Export Preparation

#### Step 1: Organize Your Roam Database

**Before Exporting:**
1. **Review Database Structure**: Identify pages and blocks you want to migrate
2. **Clean Up Content**: Remove or archive content you don't need
3. **Organize by Topic**: Consider grouping related pages for logical project structure
4. **Check References**: Ensure important block references are preserved

**Database Assessment:**
```
Recommended Pre-Export Checklist:
├── Identify core knowledge domains
├── Review page hierarchies
├── Check for broken references
├── Organize daily notes if needed
├── Archive unused content
└── Plan project structure in Taskade
```

#### Step 2: Export from Roam Research

**Export Process:**
1. **Open Roam Research** and navigate to your database
2. **Click the ☰ All Pages button** on the left sidebar
3. **Select Pages to Export:**
   - Check individual pages you want to migrate
   - Use "Select All" to export your entire knowledge base
   - Consider selective export for large databases

**Export Options:**
- **Format**: Choose **Markdown (.md)** format
- **Scope**: Select individual pages or entire database
- **Content**: Includes all blocks, references, and metadata

**Export Considerations:**

**⚠️ Partially Preserved:**
- **Block References**: Converted to static text (dynamic linking lost)
- **Bi-directional Links**: Become regular markdown links
- **Page Links**: Converted to text-based references
- **Metadata**: Some page metadata may be simplified

**❌ Not Preserved:**
- **Dynamic References**: Real-time updating block references
- **Graph View**: Visual relationship mapping
- **Query Blocks**: Dynamic content queries
- **Plugin Functionality**: Roam-specific extensions
