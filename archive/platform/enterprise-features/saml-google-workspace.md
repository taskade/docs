## Overview

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between an identity provider (IdP) and a service provider (SP). Taskade's SAML integration with Google Workspace allows organizations to implement single sign-on (SSO), where users can access Taskade using their existing Google Workspace credentials without needing separate passwords.
