# Export as Flowchart

Transform your Taskade projects into professional flowcharts that clearly visualize processes, decision trees, and workflows.

{% hint style="success" %}
Flowchart export creates clear, professional diagrams perfect for process documentation, training materials, and workflow optimization.
{% endhint %}

## Overview

The Export as Flowchart feature allows you to save your Taskade projects as high-quality flowchart images. This is particularly valuable for:

- **Process Documentation**: Map out standard operating procedures and workflows
- **Training Materials**: Create visual guides for team onboarding and process training
- **Quality Assurance**: Document decision trees and approval processes
- **Process Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks and improvement opportunities
- **Compliance Documentation**: Create visual records of regulated processes

{% hint style="info" %}
Flowchart export requires a premium subscription and projects must be viewed in Mind Map mode before exporting.
{% endhint %}

## How to Export as Flowchart

### Step 1: Prepare Your Process Data

**Structure your Taskade project for flowchart visualization:**

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Design Process Hierarchy
Organize tasks hierarchically to represent process flow:
- Top-level: Main process stages
- Subtasks: Detailed steps within each stage
- Use custom fields for decision criteria and conditions
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Add Decision Logic
Use subtasks to represent branching paths:
- Decision points as parent tasks
- Alternative paths as subtasks
- Use task descriptions for decision criteria
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Switch to Mind Map View
Click the **Mind Map** icon in the view switcher at the top of the project (second option from the right).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Verify Flowchart Layout
Ensure the mind map represents your process flow logically.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Step 2: Export the Flowchart

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Access Export Menu
Click the **three dots (···)** in the top-right corner of your project.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Select Export Option
Choose **Export** → **Export as Image** from the dropdown menu.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Download
The flowchart will automatically download as a high-resolution PNG image file.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Flowchart Structure Best Practices

### Process Mapping

**Create effective flowchart structures:**

**Start and End Points:**
```
[Start] → Process Step 1 → [Decision Point]
                    ↓
              [Yes]   [No]
                ↓      ↓
        Step 2A    Step 2B
                ↓      ↓
             [End]   [End]
```

**Decision Diamonds:**
- Use for conditional branching
- Include clear decision criteria
- Label both true and false paths

**Process Rectangles:**
- One action per rectangle
- Use active verbs (e.g., "Review Document", "Send Email")
- Keep descriptions concise

### Task Organization

**Optimize your Taskade project structure:**

**Parent Tasks as Process Stages:**
- "Order Processing" (main process)
  - "Receive Order" (step 1)
  - "Validate Payment" (decision)
    - "Payment Valid" (yes path)
    - "Request Payment" (no path)

**Custom Fields for Metadata:**
- **Process Owner**: Who is responsible for each step
- **Estimated Time**: How long each step takes
- **Required Resources**: Tools or information needed
- **Quality Checks**: Validation criteria

## Use Cases
