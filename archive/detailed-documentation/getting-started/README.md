# Quick Start Guide

**Start with Genesis. Your workspace becomes the foundation for unlimited apps.**

Every Taskade workspace begins with your **Home Subspace** — a living foundation where you'll build your first Genesis app in minutes. Skip the usual setup complexity and jump straight to creating something that works for your business.

## 🚀 **Create Your Home Subspace** (1 minute)

1. **[Sign up for free →](https://taskade.com/signup)** 
2. **Name your workspace** - This becomes your **Home Subspace**, the foundation for all your apps
3. **Verify your email** - Check your inbox and click the confirmation link
4. **Complete your profile** - Add your name, role, and profile picture

**What you just created:** Your Home Subspace is now ready! It contains the living DNA (agents, automations, knowledge) that will power every Genesis app you build.

## 🧬 **Build Your First Genesis App** (5 minutes)

**This is where the magic happens.** Instead of managing tasks manually, let's build an app that solves a real business problem.

### **Step 1: Choose Your App Idea**
Pick something you actually need (examples):
- 📝 **Customer Feedback App** - Collect reviews with automatic manager alerts
- 📅 **Booking System** - Let customers schedule appointments online
- 📊 **Inventory Tracker** - Monitor stock levels with reorder alerts
- 🎯 **Lead Manager** - Capture and qualify sales leads automatically

### **Step 2: Open the Generator Interface**
1. Your workspace **IS** the Genesis interface - no separate tab needed
2. Look for the **prominent input field at the top** of your workspace
3. You'll see your existing projects/folders as **app tiles** below the input field

### **Step 3: Describe Your App**
Use this template - be specific:
```
I run a [BUSINESS TYPE] and need [USERS] to [ACTION]. 
They should be able to [SPECIFIC FEATURES].
When [TRIGGER EVENT], automatically [AUTOMATED ACTION].
```

**Example:**
```
I run a restaurant and need customers to submit feedback about their dining experience. They should be able to rate food quality, service speed, and overall satisfaction on a 1-5 scale, plus leave optional comments and upload photos. When someone gives us 3 stars or lower, automatically send a Slack message to our manager channel so we can follow up personally.
```

### **Step 4: Watch Genesis Build Your App**
1. **Type or paste your prompt** in the input field at the top of your workspace
2. **Press Enter or click Generate** - Genesis analyzes your request
3. **Your new app appears as a tile** below the generator in 30-60 seconds
4. Genesis creates: database structure, user interface, automations, and AI functionality

### **Step 5: Test Your Live App**
1. **Click on your new app tile** to enter the app workspace
2. **Click the "Preview" tab** in the top-right panel to see your live application
3. **Test as a real user** - submit data, navigate the interface, check mobile view
4. **Verify automations work** - check your connected services (Slack, email, etc.)
5. **Use the persistent AI Agent** in the left panel to make adjustments

**🎉 Congratulations!** You just created a complete business application in minutes.

## 📊 **Understanding Your Foundation** (2 minutes)

Your Genesis app works because your Home Subspace provides the foundation:

## 🤖 **Enhance Your Apps with Custom Agents** (3 minutes)

Your Genesis app already has built-in AI, but you can create specialized agents for advanced functionality:

### **Work with the Persistent AI Agent**
1. **The AI Agent lives in the left panel** - it stays there as you navigate
2. **It understands your current context** - shown by a context pill in the chat input
3. **Ask it to enhance your apps**: 
   ```
   "Add file upload capability to my customer feedback app"
   "Connect my booking system to send confirmation emails"
   "Make the dashboard mobile-friendly with larger buttons"
   ```
4. **Train it with business knowledge** by uploading documents or describing your processes

### **How the AI Agent Powers Your Apps**
- **Context-aware assistance** - knows which app or workspace you're currently in
- **App modification** - can directly edit and improve your Genesis apps
- **Cross-app intelligence** - learns from interactions across all your applications
- **Automation connection** - can link apps to your existing automations and integrations
- **Real-time help** - persistent across all screens for instant assistance

## 👥 **Share Your Apps with Your Team** (2 minutes)

### **Share Apps with Your Team**
1. **Click the three-dot menu** next to your workspace name for settings
2. **Invite team members** with appropriate permissions
3. **Share individual apps** - each app gets its own URL that you can share anywhere
4. **Control access levels** for different users and team members

### **App Sharing Options**
- **Team Access** - Team members can access apps through your shared workspace
- **Public Links** - Every app gets a unique URL you can share with anyone
- **Access Control** - Set permissions: view-only, edit access, or admin rights
- **External Users** - Share apps with clients or customers without giving workspace access
- **No Downloads Required** - Apps work in any web browser on desktop, tablet, or mobile

## ⚡ **Connect Your Apps to Everything** (3 minutes)

Your Genesis apps already include smart automations, but you can add custom workflows:

### **Add Advanced Automations**
1. **Access automations** through the right panel or mini-panel toggle
2. **Use the AI Agent** to describe complex workflows:
   ```
   "When a customer submits feedback in my restaurant app with a rating below 3, create a HubSpot task for the manager, send a Slack alert, and schedule a follow-up email for next week"
   ```
3. **The AI Agent can view and edit** your automations directly
4. **Connect your services** - automations integrate with 100+ external tools
5. **Test with your Genesis app** - submit real data to verify workflows

### **How Automations Power Your Apps**
- **Cross-App Workflows** - Actions in one app can trigger responses in another
- **Business Intelligence** - Connect apps to analytics and reporting tools  
- **External Integrations** - Link apps to 100+ services you already use

## 💡 **Pro Tips for Better Apps**

### **Writing Effective Prompts**
Follow the help center's proven formula for great results:

**1. Set Clear Objectives**
```
"My restaurant staff needs to track inventory daily and get alerts when we're running low on key ingredients."
```

**2. Describe the Complete User Journey**
```
"Customers browse our service catalog → request quotes → upload requirements → review proposals → approve work → rate their experience afterward."
```

**3. Connect Your Existing Tools**
```
"Import customer data from Google Sheets and send automated email notifications via Gmail. Connect to Slack for team alerts."
```

**4. Define Access and Permissions**
```
"Staff can view all projects and add updates. Clients only see their own projects and can't edit. Managers access everything plus analytics."
```

### **When Things Need Adjustment**
Use the persistent AI Agent to refine your apps:

- **Add Features**: "Add file upload after the description and make the submit button bigger"
- **Fix Branding**: "Use our company colors: navy blue headers and bright green accent buttons"
- **Improve Flow**: "Make this a single-page app instead of multiple screens"
- **Connect Services**: "Send notifications to our team Slack channel when orders are submitted"

### **Testing Your Apps**
- **Preview as real users** - navigate the complete workflow
- **Test on mobile devices** - ensure buttons and forms work well
- **Submit real data** - verify automations trigger correctly
- **Share with colleagues** - get feedback before going live

*Every business problem can become a working application. What will you build next?*
