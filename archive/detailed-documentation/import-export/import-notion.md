## Export from Notion

To import your Notion pages to Taskade, you first need to export them in a compatible format.

### Export Non-Database Pages

**Export individual pages and simple content:**

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Open Your Notion Page
Navigate to the Notion page you want to export and open it
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Access Export Menu
Click the **···** (ellipsis) button in the top-right corner of the page
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Select Export Option
Choose **"Export"** from the dropdown menu
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Choose Export Format
Select **"Markdown & CSV"** as the export format
{% endstep %}

{% step %}

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Complete Export
Click **"Export"** to download a ZIP archive containing your exported files
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Export Database Pages

**For pages containing databases:**

1. **Follow the same export steps** as above for non-database pages
2. **Databases are exported as CSV files** alongside markdown files for subpages
3. **Table data** will be included in the export as structured data

**Important Notes:**
- Databases are exported as `.csv` files
- Subpages are exported as separate `.md` files
