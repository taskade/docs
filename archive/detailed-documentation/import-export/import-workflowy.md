## Troubleshooting

### Common Import Issues

**Resolve issues with Workflowy imports:**

#### File Format Problems
- **Ensure OPML Format**: Verify you're exporting from Workflowy as OPML, not other formats

#### Structure Issues
- **Hierarchy Preservation**: Deep nesting levels are maintained, but very complex structures may need review
- **Special Characters**: Unicode and special characters are supported, but encoding issues can occur
- **Empty Items**: Items without content may not import; add placeholder text if needed

#### Content Loss
- **Rich Formatting**: Workflowy supports limited formatting; complex formatting may not transfer
- **Links and Media**: External links are preserved, but embedded media may need re-attachment
- **Metadata**: Creation dates and other metadata may not transfer

### Performance Considerations

**Optimize imports for large Workflowy outlines:**

- **Split Large Outlines**: Break very large outlines into smaller, manageable sections
