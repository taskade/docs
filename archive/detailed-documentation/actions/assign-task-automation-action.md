## Assignment Strategies

### Rule-Based Assignment

**Simple Rules:**
```javascript
// Assign by department
if (task.category === "design") {
  assignTo("design_team");
} else if (task.category === "development") {
  assignTo("dev_team");
}

// Assign by priority
if (task.priority === "urgent") {
  assignTo("senior_team");
}
```

**Complex Logic:**
```javascript
// Multi-criteria assignment
const assignee = findBestMatch({
  skills: task.required_skills,
  availability: task.due_date,
  workload: "balanced",
  recent_assignments: "consider"
});
```

### Workload Balancing

**Load Distribution Methods:**

1. **Equal Distribution** - Spread tasks evenly across team
2. **Capacity-Based** - Consider individual team member capacity
3. **Skill-Weighted** - Prefer specialists for complex tasks
4. **Round-Robin** - Rotate assignments fairly

**Workload Tracking:**
```json
{
  "team_capacity": {
    "alice": { "current": 8, "capacity": 10 },
    "bob": { "current": 6, "capacity": 8 },
    "carol": { "current": 9, "capacity": 10 }
  },
  "next_assignment": "bob" // Least loaded
}
```

### Skill-Based Matching

**Skill Assessment:**
```json
{
  "task_requirements": ["javascript", "react", "api_design"],
  "team_skills": {
    "alice": ["javascript", "vue", "testing"],
    "bob": ["javascript", "react", "node"],
    "carol": ["python", "django", "api_design"]
  },
  "best_match": "bob" // Highest skill overlap
}
```

**Skill Levels:**
- **Expert** - Primary skill, extensive experience
- **Proficient** - Strong capability, regular use
- **Capable** - Basic competence, can handle with guidance
- **Learning** - Developing skill, needs supervision
