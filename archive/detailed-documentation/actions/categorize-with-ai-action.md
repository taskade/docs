**Clarity and Specificity:**
```javascript
prompt_best_practices: {
  clear_instructions: "Be explicit about what you want classified and how",
  specific_criteria: "Define clear rules for each classification category",
  examples_included: "Provide concrete examples in your prompts",
  output_structure: "Specify exact output format and field names"
}
```

**Context and Relevance:**
```javascript
context_optimization: {
  domain_knowledge: "Include relevant industry or business context",
  use_case_specificity: "Tailor prompts to your specific use case",
  audience_understanding: "Consider who will use the classifications",
  business_rules: "Incorporate your business logic and requirements"
}
```

### Operational Excellence

**Quality Assurance:**
```javascript
quality_assurance: {
  testing_regime: "Regularly test classifications with known data",
  validation_processes: "Implement validation workflows for critical classifications",
  feedback_loops: "Collect and incorporate user feedback",
  continuous_monitoring: "Monitor performance and accuracy over time"
}
```

**Scalability and Performance:**
```javascript
scalability_practices: {
  efficient_processing: "Optimize for speed and resource usage",
  batch_operations: "Use batch processing for high-volume scenarios",
  caching_strategies: "Implement intelligent caching where appropriate",
  cost_optimization: "Balance performance with processing costs"
}
```
