## Troubleshooting

### Common Completion Issues

**Task Selection Problems:**
- âœ… Verify task IDs are correctly specified and exist in the target project
- âœ… Check that automation has proper permissions to access and modify tasks
- âœ… Ensure task selection logic matches the intended completion criteria
- âœ… Test task selection independently before using in automation workflows

**Completion Validation Failures:**
- âœ… Review completion validation rules to ensure they match business requirements
- âœ… Check that all required conditions are properly configured and accessible
- âœ… Verify that dependent systems and integrations are functioning correctly
- âœ… Test validation rules with sample data to identify issues

**Integration Synchronization Issues:**
- âœ… Ensure all integrated systems are properly configured and accessible
- âœ… Check that completion events are properly synchronized across platforms
- âœ… Verify that authentication and authorization are working correctly
- âœ… Monitor integration logs for errors and connection issues
