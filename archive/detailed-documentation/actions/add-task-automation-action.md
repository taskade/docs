      "options": ["Low", "Medium", "High", "Critical"]
    },
    "estimated_hours": {
      "type": "number",
      "value": 4
    },

    }
  }
}
```

## Bulk Task Creation

### Multiple Task Addition

The Add Task action supports adding multiple tasks in a single automation execution using properly formatted text input.

**Formatting Requirements:**
- Use clear delimiters to separate individual tasks
- Each task can have independent content, due dates, and custom fields
- Maintain consistent formatting for reliable parsing

**Example Multi-Task Input:**
```
Task 1: Review quarterly budget
Due: Dec 31, 2024
Priority: High

Task 2: Schedule team meeting
Due: next Monday
Priority: Medium

Task 3: Update project documentation
Due: end of week
Priority: Low
```

### AI-Assisted Bulk Formatting

Leverage the Ask Agent action to automatically format complex task lists:

**Example AI Prompt:**
```
Format these meeting action items as individual automation-ready tasks:
- Review budget proposal (urgent, due EOW)
- Schedule stakeholder meeting (next week)
- Update project timeline (medium priority)
- Prepare presentation slides (high priority, due Friday)

Use this format:
Task: [description]
Due: [date]
Priority: [level]
```

**AI-Generated Output:**
```
Task: Review budget proposal
Due: end of week
Priority: high

Task: Schedule stakeholder meeting
Due: next week
Priority: medium

Task: Update project timeline
Due: end of week
Priority: medium

Task: Prepare presentation slides
Due: Friday
Priority: high
```
