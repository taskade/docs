## Troubleshooting

### Common Array Transformation Issues

**Array Source Problems:**
- ✅ Verify the source action (Find Task(s) or Find Row(s)) is configured correctly and returns data
- ✅ Check that the array variable reference matches exactly in the transformation action
- ✅ Ensure the source action runs successfully before the transformation step
- ✅ Test the source action independently to confirm it returns expected array data
- ✅ Check for empty arrays and handle cases where no data is returned

**Formatting and Output Issues:**
- ✅ Verify field selection includes all required array elements for the output
- ✅ Check delimiter settings and ensure they match the intended output format
- ✅ Preview the transformation output to verify formatting meets requirements
- ✅ Test with sample data to ensure transformation logic works correctly
- ✅ Validate that output length doesn't exceed platform or system limits

**Integration and Compatibility Issues:**
- ✅ Verify the output format is compatible with the receiving action or system
- ✅ Check character encoding and ensure special characters are handled correctly
- ✅ Test the complete workflow to ensure transformation output works in context
- ✅ Monitor for platform-specific limitations and adjust formatting accordingly
- ✅ Ensure transformation output meets API requirements and data specifications

**Template-Based Formatting:**
```javascript
// Custom templates for specific use cases
custom_templates: {
  email_summary: {
    template: "📋 Weekly Summary:\n{items}\n\nTotal: {count} items",
    item_template: "• {name} - {status} ({assignee})",
    variables: {
      items: "formatted_list",
      count: "item_count",
      date: "current_date"
    }
  },
  project_report: {
    template: "# {project_name} Status Report\n\n## Completed Tasks\n{completed_tasks}\n\n## In Progress\n{in_progress_tasks}\n\n## Next Steps\n{next_steps}",
    section_templates: {
      completed_tasks: "- ✅ {name} ({completed_date})",
      in_progress_tasks: "- 🔄 {name} - {progress}% complete",
      next_steps: "- 🎯 {name} (Due: {due_date})"
    }
  },
  customer_update: {
    template: "Dear {customer_name},\n\nHere's an update on your {project_type} project:\n\n{updates}\n\nBest regards,\n{account_manager}",
    update_formats: {
      completed: "✅ {task_name} has been completed",
      delayed: "⏰ {task_name} is delayed until {new_date}",
      started: "🚀 Work has begun on {task_name}"
    }
  }
}
```

**Dynamic Template Variables:**
```javascript
// Use dynamic variables in templates
