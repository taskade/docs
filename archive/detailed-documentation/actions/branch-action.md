# Branch (Automation Action)

Create intelligent, conditional workflows that automatically route tasks through different paths based on specific conditions and criteria.

{% hint style="success" %}
The Branch action transforms linear automations into dynamic, decision-driven workflows that adapt to different scenarios and requirements.
{% endhint %}

## Overview

The Branch action enables conditional logic in automation workflows, allowing tasks to follow different paths based on evaluated conditions. This creates sophisticated, adaptive automations that handle complex business logic.

**Key Features:**
- **Conditional Routing**: Direct workflows based on task/project properties
- **Multiple Paths**: Support for multiple branching conditions
- **Fallback Handling**: Ensure workflows continue when conditions aren't met
- **Dynamic Logic**: Use data from previous actions for routing decisions

## How It Works

### Basic Flow
1. **Trigger**: Automation starts with an event
2. **Condition Evaluation**: Branch evaluates specified conditions
3. **Path Selection**: Task follows first matching condition path
4. **Action Execution**: Different actions execute based on selected path
5. **Continuation**: Process continues with path-specific logic

### Branch Structure
```
Trigger Event
    ↓
Branch Condition Evaluation
    ├── Condition A → Path A Actions
    ├── Condition B → Path B Actions
    ├── Condition C → Path C Actions
    └── Fallback → Default Actions
```

## Configuration

### Setting Up Conditions

**Supported Condition Types:**
- **Task Properties**: Priority, status, assignee, due dates
- **Project Data**: Status, owner, custom fields, creation dates
- **Dynamic Values**: Data from previous automation actions
- **Complex Logic**: AND/OR combinations and nested conditions

### Fallback Configuration

**Ensure workflow continuity:**
- **Default Path**: Executes when no conditions match
- **Error Handling**: Manages unexpected scenarios
- **Logging**: Records unmatched conditions for analysis

## Use Cases

### Task Prioritization
```
Task Created
    ↓
Branch: Priority Level
    ├── High → Urgent notification + immediate assignment
    ├── Medium → Standard queue + 24h reminder
    └── Low → Backlog + weekly review
```

### Project Status Management
```
Project Updated
    ↓
Branch: Status Check
    ├── Planning → Send checklist + assign coordinator
    ├── At Risk → Escalate + mitigation tasks
    └── Completed → Generate summary + archive
```

### Client Communication Routing
```
Form Submitted
    ↓
Branch: Inquiry Type
    ├── Support → Create ticket + notify service team
    ├── Sales → Add to CRM + schedule demo
    └── Billing → Route to finance + send invoice
```

### Approval Workflows
```
Request Submitted
    ↓
Branch: Approval Amount
    ├── <$1,000 → Auto-approve
    ├── $1,000-$10,000 → Manager approval
    └── >$10,000 → Executive approval + legal review
```

### Content Publishing
```
Content Submitted
    ↓
Branch: Content Type
    ├── Breaking News → Immediate publishing workflow
    ├── Feature Article → Editorial review process
    └── Blog Post → Content team review + scheduling
```

## Advanced Features

### Complex Conditional Logic

**Combine multiple conditions:**
```javascript
// AND Logic
Priority = "High" AND Assignee = "Manager"

// OR Logic
Status = "Overdue" OR DaysPastDue > 7

// Nested Conditions
If (Budget > 10000 AND Risk = "High")
    OR (Timeline < 30 AND Priority = "Critical")
```

### Dynamic Branching

**Use previous action data:**
```
Generate AI Analysis
    ↓
Branch: Sentiment Score
    ├── Score > 8 → Publish immediately
    ├── Score 5-8 → Request revisions
    └── Score < 5 → Reject with feedback
```

### Multi-Level Branching

**Create decision trees:**
```
Level 1: Priority Check
├── High → Level 2: Urgency
│   ├── Critical → Emergency response
│   └── Important → Priority queue
└── Normal → Standard processing
```

## Best Practices

### Condition Design
- Use specific, measurable criteria
- Order from most specific to general
- Plan for edge cases and unexpected scenarios
- Document logic for future maintenance

### Performance Optimization
- Limit conditions per branch for efficiency
- Use efficient comparison operators
- Monitor execution times and success rates
- Optimize frequently used branch paths

### Testing and Monitoring
- Test each branch path individually
- Verify condition evaluation logic
- Monitor usage patterns and effectiveness
- Implement logging for debugging

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
**Conditions not matching:**
- Verify data types and formats
- Check case sensitivity in comparisons
- Ensure date formats are consistent

**Unexpected path selection:**
- Review condition priority order
- Check for overlapping conditions
- Validate data values against criteria

**Actions not executing:**
- Confirm action configurations
- Check permissions and access rights
- Verify integration connections

### Debugging Tools
- **Execution Logs**: Track path selection and condition evaluation
- **Test Mode**: Simulate different scenarios without real execution
- **Analytics**: Monitor branch usage and performance metrics

## Integration Examples

### Complete Workflows

**Support Ticket Routing:**
```
Ticket Created → Branch by priority/urgency → Route to appropriate team → Set SLA → Notify stakeholders
```

**Content Approval Process:**
```
Draft Submitted → Branch by content type → Assign reviewers → Set deadlines → Track approval status
```

**Purchase Request Approval:**
```
Request Submitted → Branch by amount/department → Route approvers → Set deadlines → Update status
```

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Limit branch creation to authorized users
- Control who can modify branch conditions
- Implement approval workflows for sensitive branches

### Data Protection
- Sanitize sensitive data in conditions
- Ensure encrypted data handling
- Maintain audit trails for compliance

## Conclusion

The Branch action enables sophisticated, adaptive automation workflows that intelligently route tasks based on business logic and conditions. Perfect for creating scalable, intelligent automations that handle complex decision-making processes.
