# Transform Array Into String (Automation Action)

Convert arrays from data sources into formatted strings for seamless integration with AI agents, email notifications, and other automation actions.

{% hint style="success" %}
The Transform Array Into String action bridges the gap between structured data arrays and human-readable or AI-processable text formats, enabling smooth data flow in complex automations.
{% endhint %}

## Overview

The Transform Array Into String action converts the output of data retrieval actions (like Find Tasks or Find Rows) into a single, formatted string. This enables arrays to be passed directly to subsequent actions or AI agents for further processing, creating seamless data transformation workflows.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Array to String Conversion**: Transform structured data arrays into readable text
- **Flexible Formatting**: Customize output structure and delimiters
- **AI Integration Ready**: Prepare data for AI agent processing
- **Email & Notification Ready**: Format data for human-readable communications

{% hint style="info" %}
This action is essential for converting machine-readable data structures into formats suitable for AI processing, email notifications, and human consumption.
{% endhint %}

## How It Works

### Basic Operation Flow

1. **Data Input**: Receive array from previous action (Find Tasks, Find Rows, etc.)
2. **Transformation Configuration**: Set formatting rules and delimiters
3. **String Generation**: Convert each array item to formatted text
4. **Output Creation**: Join items with specified separators
5. **Pass to Next Action**: Provide formatted string for subsequent processing

### Data Flow Example

```
Input Array: [
  {name: "Task 1", status: "Complete", assignee: "John"},
  {name: "Task 2", status: "In Progress", assignee: "Jane"},
  {name: "Task 3", status: "Pending", assignee: "Bob"}
]

Transform Configuration:
- Include: name, status, assignee
- Join By: New Line
- Format: "• {name} - {status} ({assignee})"

Output String:
"• Task 1 - Complete (John)
• Task 2 - In Progress (Jane)
• Task 3 - Pending (Bob)"
```

## Configuration Options
