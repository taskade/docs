### Step 2: Build Custom Agent Tools

Create specialized tools that extend your agent's capabilities.

#### Task Categorization Tool

**Tool Purpose:** Automatically sort and route tasks to appropriate departments or projects.

**Tool Configuration:**
- **Trigger Type**: Agent Tool
- **Parameters**: 
  - `task_content` (text): The task description and details
  - `task_priority` (optional): User-specified priority level
- **Processing Logic**: AI analysis → Department classification → Project routing

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Create Agent Tool Trigger**:
   - Add parameter: `task` (text) - The task to be categorized
   - Configure trigger conditions and validation

2. **Add AI Analysis Action**:
   ```
   Action: Ask Agent
   Prompt: "Analyze this task and categorize it into exactly one department:
   Marketing, Sales, Development, Operations, Design, or Other.
   Consider the task content, required skills, and business impact.
   Respond with only the department name."
   Input: @task_content
   Output Variable: department_classification
   ```

3. **Create Branching Logic**:
   ```
   Action: Branch
   Conditions:
   - If @department_classification contains "Marketing" → Route to Marketing project
   - If @department_classification contains "Sales" → Route to Sales project
   - If @department_classification contains "Development" → Route to Development project
   - If @department_classification contains "Operations" → Route to Operations project
   - If @department_classification contains "Design" → Route to Design project
   - Default → Route to General Tasks project
   ```

4. **Task Creation in Each Branch**:
   ```
   Action: Add Task
   Project: [Department-Specific Project]
   Task Title: @task_content
   Custom Fields:
   - Department: @department_classification
   - Priority: Auto-assigned based on analysis
   - Created_Date: Current timestamp
   - AI_Categorized: True
   ```

#### Email Reminder Tool

**Tool Purpose:** Generate and send contextual email reminders based on task status.

**Tool Configuration:**
- **Trigger Type**: Agent Tool
- **Parameters**:
  - `status_filter` (text): Task status to report (e.g., "blocked", "in_progress")
  - `email_recipient` (email): Who should receive the reminder

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Configure Tool Parameters**:
   - `status`: Task status filter
   - `email`: Recipient email address

2. **Task Status Query**:
   ```
   Action: Find Tasks
   Project: Weekly Planner Project
   Filter: Custom_Field_Status equals @status_filter
   Return: All matching tasks as array
   ```

3. **Content Formatting**:
   ```
   Action: Transform Array Into String
   Array: @found_tasks
   Template: "• @task.title (Priority: @task.priority, Due: @task.due_date)"
   Header: "Weekly Task Status Report - @status_filter Tasks"
   Footer: "Total tasks in this category: @total_count"
   ```

4. **Email Delivery**:
   ```
   Action: Send Email
   To: @email_recipient
   Subject: "Weekly Task Update: @status_filter Tasks (@total_count items)"
