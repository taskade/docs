{% endhint %}

## Overview

Workspace tags allow you to create unlimited color-coded labels to categorize and filter projects within workspaces or teams. This feature helps you:

- **Categorize Projects**: Group related projects by type, priority, or department
- **Quick Filtering**: Instantly filter project lists to focus on specific categories
- **Visual Organization**: Use colors to create visual distinctions between project types
- **Team Collaboration**: Share consistent tagging systems across your organization

## Creating Tags

### Add a New Tag

**Create custom tags for your workspace:**

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Access Tag Manager
Open your workspace or team and click the **‚ûï Tag** button in the project list header.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Choose Tag Option
Select from existing tags or click **‚ûï New tag** to create a custom one.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Configure Tag
Enter a name for your tag, choose a color, and click **Create**.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Tag Naming Best Practices

**Create meaningful and consistent tag names:**
- Use clear, descriptive names (e.g., "High Priority", "Q4 Projects", "Marketing")
- Keep names concise but specific
- Establish naming conventions across your organization
- Consider using prefixes for different categories (e.g., "Dept: Marketing", "Type: Client Work")

## Applying Tags to Projects

### Tag Individual Projects

**Add tags to organize your projects:**

1. **Open your workspace** or team containing the project
2. **Click the three dots (¬∑¬∑¬∑)** next to the project name
3. **Select "Add Tags"** from the menu
4. **Choose from existing tags** or create new ones
5. **Apply multiple tags** as needed

### Bulk Tag Application

**Tag multiple projects at once:**

1. **Hold Ctrl/Cmd** and click to select multiple projects
2. **Right-click** on any selected project
3. **Choose "Add Tags"** from the context menu
4. **Select the tags** to apply to all selected projects

## Filtering by Tags

### Use Filter Controls

**Filter your project list by tags:**

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Access Filter
Click the **Filter** button above the project list in your workspace or team.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Select Tags
Choose one or multiple tags to filter by from the dropdown menu.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### View Results
The project list will update to show only projects with the selected tags.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Quick Tag Filtering

**Filter directly from project tags:**

- **Click any tag** displayed below a project name in the list
- **Instant filtering** shows only projects with that tag
- **Combine filters** by selecting multiple tags
- **Clear filters** by clicking the filter button again

## Managing Tags

### Edit Existing Tags

**Modify tag names and colors:**

1. **Click the ‚ûï Tag button** in your workspace header
2. **Click the pencil (üñäÔ∏è) icon** next to the tag you want to edit
3. **Update the name** and/or **change the color**

### Delete Tags

**Remove unused tags:**

1. **Click the ‚ûï Tag button** in your workspace header
2. **Click the pencil (üñäÔ∏è) icon** next to the tag you want to delete
3. **Click the Delete button** (trash icon)
4. **Confirm deletion** - this will remove the tag from all projects

{% hint style="warning" %}
Deleting a tag removes it from all projects that use it. This action cannot be undone.
{% endhint %}

## Tag Organization Strategies

### By Project Type

**Categorize by project characteristics:**
- **Client Projects**: Tag by client name or account type
- **Internal Projects**: Mark as "Internal", "Operations", "HR"
- **Product Development**: Use tags like "Feature", "Bug Fix", "Enhancement"

### By Priority Level

**Indicate project importance:**
- **üî¥ High Priority**: Critical projects requiring immediate attention
- **üü° Medium Priority**: Important but not urgent projects
- **üü¢ Low Priority**: Nice-to-have or future projects

### By Department/Team

**Organize by organizational structure:**
- **Marketing**: Content, Campaigns, Branding
- **Sales**: Leads, Proposals, Customer Success
- **Development**: Frontend, Backend, DevOps

### By Timeline

**Track project phases:**
- **Planning**: Projects in ideation or planning phase
- **Active**: Currently in development or execution
- **Review**: Projects awaiting approval or feedback
- **Complete**: Finished projects (consider archiving)

## Advanced Tagging Techniques

### Hierarchical Tagging

**Create tag hierarchies using naming conventions:**
- **Level 1**: Main categories (e.g., "Department: Marketing")
- **Level 2**: Subcategories (e.g., "Department: Marketing - Social Media")
- **Level 3**: Specific types (e.g., "Department: Marketing - Social Media - Twitter")

### Tag Combinations

**Use multiple tags for complex categorization:**
- **Project Type + Priority**: "Client Work + High Priority"
- **Department + Timeline**: "Development + Q4 2024"
- **Status + Owner**: "In Progress + John Doe"

### Automated Tagging

**Set up automation for consistent tagging:**
- **Project Creation**: Auto-tag new projects based on creator or template
- **Status Changes**: Automatically update tags when project status changes
- **Due Date Approaching**: Add "Urgent" tag when deadlines near

## Best Practices

### Consistency

**Maintain tagging standards:**
- **Standardize naming**: Use consistent capitalization and formatting
- **Limit tag count**: Don't create too many tags (aim for 10-20 per workspace)
- **Regular cleanup**: Remove unused tags periodically
- **Team agreement**: Ensure all team members understand tag meanings

### Color Coding

**Use colors strategically:**
- **Red**: High priority or urgent items
- **Yellow/Orange**: Medium priority or warnings
- **Green**: Completed items or low priority
- **Blue**: Information or ongoing work
- **Purple**: Special projects or VIP clients

### Performance Considerations

**Optimize for speed:**
- **Bulk operations**: Use bulk tagging for efficiency
- **Smart defaults**: Set up default tags for common project types
- **Archive old tags**: Remove tags from completed/archived projects
