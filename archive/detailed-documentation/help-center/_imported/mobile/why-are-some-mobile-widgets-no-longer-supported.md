**Why are some Mobile Widgets no longer supported?**

We are upgrading our mobile widgets to offer you even more features!

**Why are there two widget options in my app?**

You may notice the old widgets as a selectable option when configuring your widgets. We will continue to support them for a short period to ensure your workflow remains uninterrupted. However, we recommend switching to the new widgets at your earliest convenience.

**What improvements do the new widgets have?**

The new widgets include all functionalities of the old versions, plus more! The My Task widget, for instance, allows you to mark tasks as complete directly from the widget. Additionally, it provides the ability to filter tasks by workspace and folders.
