**Set Up Your HR Workspace**
----------------------------

Configuring a workspace for your team in Taskade is the first step to efficient HR management. Consider your processes and choose a structure that suits your workflow. Here are two examples:

### **Example 1: Department-Centric Organization**

In this setup, the HR workspace is organized around different HR departments or functions within the organization. It includes folders representing key HR functions such as Recruitment, Employee Onboarding, and Performance Management. Each folder contains projects specific to that function. Tags categorize projects by department (e.g., Marketing) and status (e.g., In Progress).

**üóÇÔ∏è Level****üí° Example**
**Workspace**HR Hub
**Folders**Recruitment
Employee Onboarding
Performance Management
**Projects (Examples)**Job Postings
Applicant Tracking
Performance Reviews
Employee Feedback
**Tags**Department (e.g., Marketing)
Project Status (e.g., In Progress)

### **Example 2: Role-Centric Organization**

In this alternative setup, the HR workspace is organized around specific roles within the HR team. Each role has its dedicated folder which contains projects specific to the tasks and responsibilities of that role. Tags are used to categorize projects by urgency and task status.

**üóÇÔ∏è Level****üí° Example**
**Workspace**Team-Centric HR Operations
**Folders**HR Management
Talent Acquisition Specialist
Learning & Development Officer
**Projects (Examples)**Policy Revision
Campus Recruitment Drive
Leadership Development
Employee Satisfaction Survey
**Tags**Priority (e.g., High, Medium)
Task Status (e.g., Open, Closed)
