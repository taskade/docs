Fallback
--------

The fallback option ensures that your automation continues even if no conditions are met. If none of the defined paths match, the workflow will follow a fallback route.

Set up a fallback path:

Use Cases
---------

Not sure how to use the Branch action? Here are a few ideas:

**ðŸª„ Use Case****ðŸ”¤ Description**
**Task prioritization**Automatically route tasks to different workflows based on priority levels (e.g., High Priority goes to urgent queue, Low Priority to a regular queue).
**Project status updates**Depending on project status (e.g., "In Progress," "Completed"), trigger different actions like notifying stakeholders or archiving completed tasks.
**Client communication**Direct client inquiries to different paths based on urgency or type (e.g., support requests go to customer service, while sales inquiries go to sales team).
**Client onboarding**Customize the onboarding process for new clients by branching the workflow based on client type (e.g., small business vs. enterprise).
**Approval processes**Route tasks through different approval paths depending on the task's nature (e.g., financial approvals vs. content approvals).
