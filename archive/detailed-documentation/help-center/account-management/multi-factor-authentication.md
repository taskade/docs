# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Secure your Taskade account with Multi-Factor Authentication for enhanced protection against unauthorized access.

## Overview

{% hint style="success" %}
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an essential layer of security to your Taskade account by requiring multiple forms of verification before granting access.
{% endhint %}

Multifactor authentication (MFA) is a security process that requires more than one method of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify the user's identity. By requiring multiple forms of verification, MFA enhances security, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to gain access to your account.

## Why Use MFA?

| **Security Benefit** | **Description** |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Password Protection** | Even if your password is compromised, attackers still need the second factor |
| **Account Security** | Prevents unauthorized access to your projects, agents, and workspace data |
| **Compliance Ready** | Meets security requirements for business and enterprise use cases |
| **Peace of Mind** | Know your account is protected with industry-standard security practices |

## Using MFA for Login

### Normal Login Process

1. **Enter Credentials**: Username/email and password as usual
2. **MFA Challenge**: Taskade prompts for your second factor
3. **Verify**: Enter code from authenticator app or use backup code
4. **Access Granted**: Successfully logged into your account

### Login with Backup Codes

Each backup code can only be used once. Keep them secure and generate new ones when needed.
{% endhint %}

**To use a backup code:**
1. When prompted for MFA, select "Use backup code"
2. Enter one of your unused backup codes
3. The code will be consumed and you'll gain access
4. Generate new backup codes after login

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I Use SMS Instead of an Authenticator App?

Currently, Taskade MFA supports authenticator apps and backup codes. SMS-based 2FA is not available, as authenticator apps provide superior security through TOTP (Time-based One-Time Passwords).

### What Happens If I Lose My Phone?

If you lose your phone with the authenticator app:
1. Use backup codes to log in (if available)
2. Contact support for account recovery assistance
3. Set up MFA again with a new device after recovery

### Can I Have MFA on Multiple Devices?

Yes! You can set up the same authenticator app on multiple devices. Some apps (like Authy) also offer cloud backup and multi-device synchronization for easier management.

### Is MFA Required for All Accounts?

MFA is optional for individual accounts but highly recommended. Enterprise workspaces may have MFA requirements enforced by administrators.

### How Often Should I Change Backup Codes?

Regenerate backup codes:
- After using several codes
- When setting up MFA on a new device
- Periodically for security (every 6-12 months)
- If you suspect any codes may have been compromised
