# Slack Integration

Connect Taskade with Slack to streamline team communication, automate notifications, and enhance collaboration between your project management and communication workflows.

{% hint style="success" %}
Slack integration enables seamless communication between Taskade and your team's Slack workspace, ensuring everyone stays informed and aligned.
{% endhint %}

## Overview

The Slack integration provides two main capabilities:

1. **🤖 Agent Tool Integration** - AI agents can send messages and manage Slack conversations
2. **⚙️ Automation Actions** - Automate notifications and responses based on Taskade events

## Agent Tool Integration

### Connect AI Agents to Slack

Enable your custom AI agents to interact with Slack for automated communication and team coordination.

{% hint style="info" %}
Agent tool integration allows AI agents to send messages, respond to queries, and manage team communication through Slack channels and direct messages.
{% endhint %}

Go to your custom agent and click **Settings** → **Tools**.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Add Slack Tool
Click **+ Add Tool** and select **Slack**.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Authorize Access
Sign in to Slack and grant the necessary permissions.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Configure Channels

## Advanced Integration Patterns

### Bidirectional Communication

Create two-way communication between Taskade and Slack:

```
Slack → Taskade:
New Message in #help → Create Task → Assign to support

Taskade → Slack:
Task Completed → Send Update → Close communication loop
```

### Conditional Messaging

Implement smart messaging based on context:

```
If Priority = "High" → Send to #urgent + @manager
Else If Priority = "Medium" → Send to #team-updates
Else → Send to #general-updates
```

### Escalation Workflows

Set up automatic escalation for unresolved issues:

```
Task Overdue → Send reminder to assignee
After 2 days → Send to manager
After 5 days → Send to #leadership + escalate priority
```

### Channel Management

Automate channel creation and user management:

```
New Project Created → Create #project-{name} channel
→ Invite team members
→ Set channel topic with project details
→ Pin important documents
```

## Message Formatting & Templates

### Rich Message Formatting

Slack supports rich formatting for better communication:

```json
{
  "channel": "#general",
  "text": "Project Update",
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "header",
      "text": {
        "type": "plain_text",
        "text": "🚀 Sprint Complete!"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "section",
      "fields": [
        {
          "type": "mrkdwn",
          "text": "*Completed:* 15 tasks"
        },
        {
          "type": "mrkdwn",
          "text": "*Velocity:* 85 points"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Dynamic Content Variables

Use Taskade data in your Slack messages:

- `{task.name}` - Task title
- `{task.assignee}` - Assigned user
- `{task.due_date}` - Due date
- `{project.name}` - Project name
- `{user.name}` - Current user
- `{workspace.name}` - Workspace name

### Message Templates

Create reusable message templates:

```json
"task_assigned": {
  "template": "👤 *{assignee}* has been assigned: *{task.name}*\n📅 Due: {due_date}\n📋 Project: {project.name}",
  "channel": "#team-tasks"
},
"milestone_complete": {
  "template": "🎉 *Milestone Complete!* \n✅ {task.name}\n👤 Completed by: {assignee}\n📊 Progress: {progress}%",
  "channel": "#project-updates"
}
```

## Security & Permissions

### Slack App Permissions

The integration requires these Slack permissions:

- **channels:read** - View channel information
- **chat:write** - Send messages
- **chat:write.public** - Send messages to public channels
- **users:read** - Access user information
- **channels:manage** - Create and manage channels (optional)

### Data Privacy

- **Encryption:** All data transmitted over HTTPS
- **Access Control:** Only authorized users can configure integrations
- **Message Content:** Respect data sensitivity in automated messages
- **Audit Logging:** All integration activities are logged
- **User Consent:** Ensure compliance with workspace communication policies

### Best Practices

- **Channel Organization:** Use clear naming conventions for channels
- **Message Frequency:** Avoid notification overload
- **Content Sensitivity:** Consider message content and audience
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test automations before going live
- **Monitoring:** Regularly review integration performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Errors:**
- ✅ Re-authorize Slack connection
- ✅ Check Slack app permissions
- ✅ Verify workspace admin approval

**Messages Not Sending:**
- ✅ Confirm channel access permissions
- ✅ Check message content length limits
- ✅ Verify automation is enabled

**Triggers Not Working:**
- ✅ Ensure proper Slack event subscriptions
- ✅ Check channel membership
- ✅ Verify trigger conditions

### Performance Optimization

**Message Batching:**
- Combine multiple updates into single messages
- Use threads for related communications
- Schedule digests instead of real-time updates

**Rate Limiting:**
- Respect Slack API rate limits (1 request/second)
- Implement message queuing for high-volume scenarios
- Use webhooks for critical real-time notifications

## Integration Limits & Quotas

### Slack API Limits

## Advanced Features

### Interactive Messages

Create messages with buttons and actions:

```json
{
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "actions",
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "button",

            "text": "Approve"
          },
          "action_id": "approve_request"
        },
        {
          "type": "button",
          "text": {
            "type": "plain_text",
            "text": "Deny"
          },
          "action_id": "deny_request"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Thread Management

Use threads for organized conversations:

```
Main Message: "Sprint Planning Complete ✅"
Thread Reply: "Detailed breakdown of committed tasks"
Thread Reply: "Resource allocation summary"
Thread Reply: "Risk assessment and mitigation plans"
```

### Custom Emoji & Reactions

Use custom emoji for better visual communication:
