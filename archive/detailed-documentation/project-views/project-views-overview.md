# Project Views Overview

Discover Taskade's eight unique project views that transform how you visualize, organize, and interact with your work. Each view offers a specialized perspective on your project data, allowing you to work in the way that feels most natural and productive.

Project views are like different lenses through which you can see your work - your data stays the same, but the presentation adapts to your needs and workflow preferences.
{% endhint %}

## Understanding Project Views

### The Origami Method

Inspired by the Japanese art of paper folding, Taskade's project views work like origami - you start with the same piece of "paper" (your project data) but can fold and shape it in different ways to create different forms.

**Key Concept:** Your project data is stored in a flexible, tree-structured database. Project views are simply different ways of visualizing and interacting with that same underlying data. Switch between views anytime without losing information.

### Why Multiple Views Matter

Different projects and tasks benefit from different visual approaches:

| Project Type | Recommended View | Why It Works |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Creative Brainstorming** | Mind Map | Visual, non-linear idea exploration |
| **Task Management** | List/Outline | Hierarchical organization and tracking |
| **Workflow Management** | Board/Kanban | Visual progress tracking |
| **Data Analysis** | Table/Actionsheet | Spreadsheet-like data manipulation |
| **Project Planning** | Gantt Chart | Timeline and dependency visualization |
| **Team Organization** | Org Chart | Hierarchical relationship display |
| **Time Management** | Calendar | Schedule and deadline focus |

2. **How do I prefer to work?**
   - Visual thinker → Mind Map, Board, Org Chart
   - Detail-oriented → List/Outline, Table
   - Timeline-focused → Calendar, Gantt Chart

3. **What's my collaboration style?**
   - Team coordination → Board/Kanban, Table
