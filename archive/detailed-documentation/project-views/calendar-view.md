## Frequently Asked Questions

### Recurring Tasks Display

**Q: Recurring tasks only appear once on my calendar; I want to see every occurrence—how do I do that?**

**A:** This is intended behavior—recurring tasks will only show once on your calendar. Once the task has been completed, the next recurrence of that task will appear.

### Google Calendar Sync Issues

**Q: I only see one Taskade calendar in Google Calendar but have many folders and projects. Is this an issue?**

**A:** All your folders and projects are synced to one Taskade calendar on Google Calendar. They are not separated by folder/project.

**Q: I've created tasks in Taskade but they are not showing up on Google Calendar.**

**A:** The tasks must have due dates and be assigned to you. Make sure that the tasks are created in an upgraded synced workspace/folder.

**Q: I've created tasks in Google Calendar but they are not showing in Taskade, why?**

**A:** Events need to be created in Google Calendar to sync to Taskade calendar. Creating Google Calendar tasks will not work.

**Q: My other Google Calendar events are not syncing with Taskade, why?**

**A:** Any existing events in your other calendars besides the one named "Taskade" will not appear in the Taskade calendar. Events in Google Calendar must be created under the "Taskade" calendar for them to show up.
