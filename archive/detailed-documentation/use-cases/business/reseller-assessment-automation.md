### 3. Creating the Assessment Automation

Build the automated evaluation and routing system:

**Automation Trigger:**
```
Trigger: New Item in Project (Assessment Forms)
Condition: When new reseller application is submitted
```

**Assessment Workflow:**

**Step 1: Data Extraction**
```
Action: Extract Form Data
- Company Name: @form.company_name
- Industry: @form.industry
- Market Focus: @form.target_markets
- Experience: @form.reselling_experience
- Resources: @form.sales_resources
- Contact: @form.primary_contact
```

**Step 2: AI Assessment**
```
Action: Ask Agent
Agent: Reseller Assessment Agent
Prompt: "Evaluate this potential reseller application:

Company: @company_name
Industry: @industry
Market Focus: @market_focus
Experience: @experience
Resources: @resources

Provide assessment including:
- Compatibility score (1-10)
- Partnership tier recommendation
- Key qualifications and concerns
- Recommended follow-up actions"

Output Variables:
- assessment_score: @agent_response.score
- partnership_tier: @agent_response.tier
- recommendations: @agent_response.recommendations
- concerns: @agent_response.concerns
```

**Step 3: Intelligent Routing**
```
Action: Branch
Conditions:
- If @assessment_score >= 8 → Route to "High-Priority Partners" project
- If @assessment_score >= 6 → Route to "Qualified Partners" project
- If @assessment_score >= 4 → Route to "Potential Partners" project
- Default → Route to "Needs Review" project

Within each branch:
Action: Add Task
Project: [Tier-Specific Project]
Task Title: "Assess: @company_name (@assessment_score/10)"
Description: "@recommendations
Concerns: @concerns
Contact: @contact"
Custom Fields:
- Assessment_Score: @assessment_score
- Partnership_Tier: @partnership_tier
- Assessment_Date: Current timestamp
- Status: "Ready for Outreach"
```

**Step 4: Automated Email Outreach**
```
Action: Send Email (for High-Priority Partners)
To: @contact
Subject: "Partnership Opportunity with [Your Company Name]"
Body: "Dear [Contact Name],

### 4. Setting Up Tracking and Analytics

Create comprehensive tracking for reseller pipeline management:

**Tracking Dashboard Structure:**
```
Reseller Pipeline Overview
├── 📊 High-Priority Partners (Score 8-10)
│   ├── Ready for Outreach
│   ├── Initial Contact Made
│   ├── Meeting Scheduled
│   └── Partnership Agreement Sent
├── 🔄 Qualified Partners (Score 6-7)
│   ├── Needs Follow-up
│   ├── Information Requested
│   └── Under Review
├── 🎯 Potential Partners (Score 4-5)
│   ├── Additional Information Needed
│   ├── Trial Partnership Considered
│   └── Follow-up Scheduled
└── 📋 Needs Review (Score < 4)
    ├── Incomplete Applications
    ├── Does Not Meet Criteria
    └── Archived Applications
```

## Integration with Google Sheets

### Alternative Data Collection Method

If you already collect reseller information through other systems, you can integrate with Google Sheets:

**Google Sheets Integration Setup:**
1. **Create Assessment Spreadsheet**: Set up Google Sheet with columns matching your form fields
2. **Configure Sheet Headers**: Ensure column names match automation variable names
3. **Set Up Triggers**: Use "New Row in Google Sheets" trigger instead of form submissions

**Sheet Structure Example:**
```
| Company_Name | Industry | Target_Markets | Reselling_Experience | Sales_Resources | Primary_Contact | Submission_Date |
|--------------|----------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
```

**Automation Modification:**
```
Trigger: New Row in Google Sheets
Sheet: Reseller Applications
→ Extract row data using column headers
→ Continue with AI assessment workflow as normal
```

This approach allows you to maintain existing data collection processes while leveraging Taskade's AI assessment capabilities.
