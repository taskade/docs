## What Are Scheduled Templates?

Scheduled templates offer a convenient way to create recurring projects based on pre-defined templates. You can schedule a template for one-time creation on a specific date and time or to have it recur at regular intervals (e.g., every day at 8:00 AM).

### Key Benefits

- **Time-saving**: Automate project creation instead of setting up repeating projects from scratch
- **Consistency**: Standardize recurring projects and reduce errors
- **Better planning**: Plan ahead and allocate resources more efficiently

## Best Practices

### Template Design for Scheduling

**Optimize your templates for recurring use:**

- **Clear naming**: Use descriptive names that include dates or sequence numbers
- **Standard structure**: Maintain consistent sections and task hierarchies
- **Dynamic content**: Include placeholders for dates, assignees, or variable content
- **Minimal customization**: Design for quick review rather than extensive editing

### Common Use Cases

| Use Case | Template Type | Frequency |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Daily Standups** | Team status updates, blockers, priorities | Daily |
| **Weekly Planning** | Goal setting, task assignment, resource allocation | Weekly |
| **Monthly Reports** | Performance metrics, progress reviews, forecasts | Monthly |
| **Content Calendar** | Article planning, social media scheduling | Weekly |
| **Project Retrospectives** | What went well, improvements needed | Weekly/Monthly |

### Managing Recurring Projects

**Keep your workspace organized with scheduled projects:**

- **Archive old projects**: Regularly archive completed recurring projects
- **Use consistent naming**: Include dates in project names for easy identification
- **Set up notifications**: Configure alerts for new project creation
- **Review and adjust**: Periodically assess if scheduled templates still meet your needs

## Troubleshooting

### Template Not Creating Projects

**If your scheduled template isn't working:**

- Check that the template still exists and hasn't been deleted
- Verify your scheduling settings and frequency
- Ensure you have sufficient workspace permissions
- Confirm your account has available project slots

### Projects Creating at Wrong Time

**Fix timing issues with scheduled templates:**

- Check your account's time zone settings
- Verify the scheduled time matches your expectations
- Account for any daylight saving time changes
- Review server time vs. your local time

### Template Changes Not Applied

**Update scheduled templates with new changes:**

- Edit the original template, not the scheduled instances
- Scheduled projects use the template state at time of scheduling
- Reschedule the template to apply recent changes
- Delete and recreate the schedule if needed
