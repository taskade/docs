{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Prompt Engineering

{% hint style="info" %}
Well-crafted prompts are the foundation of effective AI interactions. Follow these guidelines for optimal results.
{% endhint %}

#### Prompt Structure

**Clear Instructions:**
```
"Analyze this customer feedback and categorize it as: Bug Report, Feature Request, or General Feedback. Provide a brief summary and suggested action."
```

**Context Provision:**
```
"Using our company style guide, rewrite this marketing copy to be more engaging while maintaining our brand voice."
```

**Output Formatting:**
```
"Summarize the quarterly sales report in 3 bullet points, focusing on: revenue growth, top products, and customer acquisition."
```

#### Common Prompt Patterns

{% expand title="Analysis Prompts" %}
**Data Analysis:**
- "Compare these two market reports and highlight key differences"
- "Identify trends in this customer feedback data"
- "Summarize the main findings from this research report"

**Content Review:**
- "Review this contract for potential risks and liabilities"
- "Check this content for SEO optimization opportunities"
- "Analyze this code for potential security vulnerabilities"
{% endexpand %}

{% expand title="Generation Prompts" %}
**Content Creation:**
- "Write a product description for our new software feature"
- "Create a social media post announcing our upcoming event"
- "Draft an email response to this customer inquiry"

**Planning & Strategy:**
- "Create a 30-60-90 day plan for launching this new product"
- "Develop a crisis communication strategy for our company"
- "Design a customer onboarding workflow"
{% endexpand %}

### Agent Architecture

#### Single-Purpose Agents

{% hint style="warning" %}
Specialized agents perform better than general-purpose ones. Each agent should have a clear, focused role.
{% endhint %}

**Examples:**
- **Customer Support Agent**: Handles inquiries, troubleshooting, documentation
- **Content Marketing Agent**: Creates blog posts, social media, email campaigns
- **Data Analysis Agent**: Processes reports, generates insights, creates visualizations
- **Project Management Agent**: Tracks progress, manages timelines, coordinates teams

#### Multi-Agent Teams

**Coordination Strategies:**

**Sequential Processing:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Research Agent] --> B[Analysis Agent]
    B --> C[Content Agent]
    C --> D[Review Agent]
```

**Parallel Processing:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Lead Data] --> B[Qualification Agent]
    A --> C[Scoring Agent]
    A --> D[Research Agent]
    B --> E[Sales Team Assignment]
    C --> E
    D --> E
```

## Automation Best Practices

### Workflow Design Principles

{% hint style="success" %}
Well-designed automations are reliable, maintainable, and scalable. Follow these core principles.
{% endhint %}

#### Single Responsibility

**Each automation should do one thing well:**
- **Data processing** automation: Handle form submissions
- **Notification** automation: Send alerts and updates
- **Content generation** automation: Create reports and summaries
- **Integration** automation: Sync data between systems

#### Error Handling

**Robust error management:**

{% expand title="Retry Strategies" %}
**Exponential Backoff:**
```yaml
retry_policy:
  max_attempts: 3
  initial_delay: 1s
  multiplier: 2
  max_delay: 60s
```

**Conditional Retries:**
- Retry only on transient errors (network timeouts, rate limits)
- Don't retry on permanent errors (authentication failures, invalid data)
- Log all retry attempts for debugging
{% endexpand %}

#### Monitoring & Alerting

**Key metrics to track:**
- Success/failure rates
- Execution times
- Error patterns
- Resource usage

### Performance Optimization

#### Batch Processing

**Efficient data handling:**

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Identify Batch Opportunities
Look for operations that can be grouped together
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Set Optimal Batch Sizes
Balance speed vs. resource usage (typically 10-50 items)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Implement Parallel Processing
Process multiple batches simultaneously when possible
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Add Progress Tracking
Monitor completion rates and handle partial failures
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

#### Caching Strategies

**Smart data reuse:**

**Result Caching:**
- Cache expensive API calls for 15-60 minutes
- Store frequently accessed data in memory
- Implement cache invalidation when data changes

**Configuration Caching:**
- Cache automation settings and mappings
- Store integration credentials securely
- Update cache when configurations change

### Security & Compliance

#### Data Protection

{% hint style="warning" %}
Always prioritize data security and compliance requirements.
{% endhint %}

**Best Practices:**
- **Encryption**: Use encrypted connections and data storage
- **Access control**: Implement role-based permissions
- **Audit trails**: Log all automation activities
- **Data retention**: Follow retention policies for sensitive data

**Compliance Considerations:**
- **GDPR**: Data subject rights and consent management
- **HIPAA**: Protected health information handling
- **SOX**: Financial data controls and auditability
- **Industry standards**: ISO 27001, SOC 2 compliance

## Team Collaboration Optimization
