# Create a Team Folder

Organize related projects, templates, and team members within dedicated folders inside your workspace for better collaboration and structure.

{% hint style="success" %}
Team folders act as organizational containers within workspaces, allowing you to group related projects, manage team-specific permissions, and create focused work environments for different departments, clients, or initiatives.
{% endhint %}

## Overview

Team folders (formerly called "Teams") are organizational containers within Taskade workspaces that help you structure and manage related projects, templates, and team members. Think of them as digital folders on your computer - they allow you to group similar work together while maintaining separate permissions, members, and workflows.

Team folders are particularly valuable for organizations that need to:
- **Organize by Department**: Group projects by marketing, sales, engineering, etc.
- **Manage Client Work**: Keep client-specific projects and assets organized
- **Control Access**: Provide different permission levels for different teams
- **Maintain Focus**: Help team members concentrate on relevant work
- **Scale Collaboration**: Support multiple teams within larger organizations

## Understanding Team Folders vs Workspaces

### Workspace Structure Hierarchy

```
Workspace (Top Level)
├── Team Folder A
│   ├── Project 1
│   ├── Project 2
│   └── Template Library A
├── Team Folder B
│   ├── Project 3
│   ├── Project 4
│   └── Template Library B
└── Shared Projects (Workspace Level)
```

### Key Differences

**Workspaces:**
- Top-level organizational unit
- Contains multiple team folders
- Shared billing and ownership
- Cross-team collaboration possible
- Global workspace settings

**Team Folders:**
- Sub-containers within workspaces
- Separate member management
- Individual permission controls
- Focused team collaboration
- Department or project-specific organization
