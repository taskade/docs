{% endhint %}

## Overview

Workspaces in Taskade serve as the top-level organizational containers for your work. Think of them as dedicated hubs where you can organize related projects, manage team collaboration, and maintain focused work environments for different aspects of your business or personal life.

### What is a Workspace?

A workspace is a collection of:
- **Projects**: Individual work items and task collections
- **Folders**: Organized groupings of related projects (formerly called "Teams")
- **Templates**: Reusable project structures and workflows
- **Team Members**: Collaborators with varying permission levels
- **AI Agents**: Specialized assistants trained for your workspace
- **Automations**: Custom workflows and integrations

### When to Create Multiple Workspaces

Consider creating separate workspaces for:
- **Different Business Units**: Marketing, Sales, Engineering, HR
- **Client Work**: Dedicated spaces for client projects and communications
- **Personal vs. Professional**: Separate work and personal productivity
- **Team Projects**: Department-specific or cross-functional initiatives
- **Product Lines**: Different products or service offerings
