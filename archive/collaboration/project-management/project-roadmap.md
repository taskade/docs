## Overview

The Project Roadmap is a powerful timeline visualization tool that allows you to view and manage multiple projects simultaneously. Unlike individual project views, the Roadmap provides a bird's-eye perspective of your entire project portfolio, making it ideal for:

- **Portfolio Management**: Track multiple projects across teams or departments
- **Timeline Visualization**: See project start dates, end dates, and dependencies
- **Resource Planning**: Identify overlapping projects and resource conflicts
- **Executive Reporting**: Provide clear visual summaries of project status
- **Strategic Planning**: Align project timelines with business objectives

### Key Differences from My Tasks

**Roadmap vs. My Tasks:**
- **Roadmap**: Focuses on *project-level* timeline visualization for portfolio management
- **My Tasks**: Focuses on *individual task* tracking and personal productivity

## Accessing the Roadmap

### Desktop/Web Access

1. Navigate to your **workspace** or **folder**
2. Click on the **üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap** tab in the main navigation
3. The roadmap view will display all projects with due dates

### Mobile Access

The Roadmap feature is optimized for desktop viewing. For mobile devices, consider using:
- **Calendar View**: For timeline visualization on mobile
- **Table View**: For project status tracking
- **List View**: For quick project overview

## Adding Projects to the Roadmap

### Automatic Inclusion

Projects appear on the Roadmap automatically when they have due dates assigned:

1. **Open any project** in your workspace
2. **Set a due date** for the project (single date or date range)
3. **Save the project** - it will now appear on the Roadmap

### Project Due Date Options

**Single Date Projects:**
- Projects with a specific completion target date
- Displayed as milestone markers on the timeline

**Date Range Projects:**
- Projects with defined start and end dates
- Displayed as timeline bars spanning the project duration

## Managing Projects on the Roadmap

1. **Click and hold** the corner edges of a project bar
2. **Drag left or right** to adjust the start/end dates
3. **Release** to save the new date range

**Reposition Projects:**
1. **Click and hold** the center of a project bar
2. **Drag up or down** to move to different timeline positions
