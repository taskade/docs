2. Click the three dots (···) menu in the top-right corner
3. Select "Project Settings"
4. Click on the "Appearance" tab
5. Browse available wallpapers or select "Random" for a surprise aesthetic

## Choosing Color Themes

### Workspace-Inherited Themes

Project color themes are inherited from their parent workspace/folder, ensuring visual consistency across related projects. This means the accent colors of links and navigation elements are automatically applied from the workspace level.

**Color Theme Options:**
- **Accent Colors:** Links, navigation elements, and UI highlights
- **Theme Consistency:** All projects in a workspace share the same color scheme
- **Workspace-Level Control:** Change colors at the workspace level to affect all projects
- **Inheritance Rules:** Projects automatically adopt workspace color themes unless individually overridden

### Custom Color Selection

**Steps:**
1. Go to your workspace settings
2. Navigate to the "Appearance" or "Theme" section
3. Select from predefined color palettes
4. Choose custom colors if advanced options are available

## Setting Default Project View

### Persistent View Preferences

Taskade allows you to set a default view that opens automatically when you access a project.

**Supported Views:**
- List/Outline View (hierarchical organization)
- Board/Kanban View (visual task tracking)
- Mind Map View (radial idea organization)
- Calendar View (time-based visualization)
- Table View (spreadsheet-style data management)

**Configuration Steps:**
1. Open the project you want to configure
2. Switch to your preferred view (List, Board, Mind Map, Calendar, Table, etc.)
3. Click the view selector dropdown in the top navigation
4. Select "Set as Default View" option
5. The chosen view will now open by default for all team members accessing this project

**Default View Benefits:**
- **Consistency:** All team members see the same initial view
- **Workflow Optimization:** Start with your most-used view automatically
- **Team Alignment:** Ensure everyone begins with the most effective perspective

## Project Icons and Visual Identity

### Custom Project Icons

Add visual identifiers to help you quickly recognize and navigate between projects.

**Icon Options:**
- **Emoji Icons:** Choose from a wide range of emojis for visual categorization
- **Custom Uploads:** Upload your own icon images (if supported)
- **Color Coding:** Use icon colors to represent project types or priorities

### Icon Management

**Removing Project Icons:**
