{% endhint %}

## Overview

In collaborative work environments, team members often join and leave projects as their roles and responsibilities change. Taskade provides a clean way to leave projects you're no longer involved with, ensuring you maintain access only to projects that are relevant to your current work.

### What Happens When You Leave a Project

**Access Changes:**
- ✅ You lose access to the project and all its content
- ✅ You stop receiving notifications from the project
- ✅ Your assignments in the project are removed
- ✅ The project disappears from your project list

**Data Preservation:**
- ✅ The project remains intact for other team members
- ✅ All project content and history is preserved
- ✅ Other collaborators retain full access
- ✅ Project ownership and settings remain unchanged

**Irreversible Action:**
- ⚠️ Leaving a project cannot be undone
- ⚠️ You cannot rejoin without being re-invited
- ⚠️ All your contributions remain in the project history

## When to Leave a Project

### Appropriate Scenarios

**Project Completion:**
- ✅ Project deliverables are complete
- ✅ Your role in the project has ended
- ✅ Project is being archived or closed
- ✅ You've handed off responsibilities to others

**Role Changes:**
- ✅ You've moved to a different team or department
- ✅ Your responsibilities have shifted away from this project
- ✅ You're no longer the right person for assigned tasks
- ✅ Project scope has changed and no longer involves you

**Workspace Organization:**
- ✅ Maintaining focus on active, relevant projects
- ✅ Reducing notification overload
- ✅ Cleaning up your project list
- ✅ Following team workflow guidelines

### When NOT to Leave a Project

**Avoid Leaving If:**
- ❌ You're still responsible for any tasks
- ❌ Project is ongoing and needs your input
- ❌ You need to reference project information later
- ❌ You're the project owner or primary contact
- ❌ Project contains information you'll need in the future

## Alternatives to Leaving

### Consider These Options First

**Archive or Favorite:**

- **Document Handover**: Create notes for knowledge transfer
- **Update Documentation**: Ensure project docs reflect current state

**Change Notification Settings:**
- **Mute Notifications**: Stop receiving updates without leaving
- **Custom Alerts**: Set up selective notifications
- **Digest Mode**: Receive summary updates instead of real-time alerts

**Adjust Project Role:**
- **Change Permissions**: Request reduced access level instead of leaving
- **View-Only Access**: Maintain visibility without editing rights
- **Limited Participation**: Stay informed but reduce involvement

## Implications of Leaving

### For You (The Person Leaving)

**Immediate Effects:**

**Long-term Considerations:**

### For the Project and Team

**Team Impact:**

**Project Continuity:**
- **Content Preservation**: All project content remains intact
- **History Retention**: Complete project history is maintained
- **Collaborator Access**: Other team members unaffected
- **Project Settings**: Ownership and permissions remain unchanged

**Alternative Solutions:**

- **Team Consultation**: Discuss with team about appropriate access level

## Project Owner Considerations

### Managing Team Departures

**As a Project Owner:**
- ✅ **Monitor Membership**: Keep track of active team members
- ✅ **Reassign Tasks**: Quickly reassign tasks from leaving members
- ✅ **Update Permissions**: Adjust access levels as team changes
- ✅ **Document Changes**: Record personnel changes in project history

**Preventive Measures:**

- ✅ **Documentation Standards**: Maintain comprehensive project documentation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Can't Leave Project:**
- **Ownership Check**: Project owners cannot leave their own projects

- **Contact Support**: Reach out to Taskade support for assistance

**Accidentally Left:**
- **Contact Owner**: Ask project owner to re-invite you
- **Explain Situation**: Describe why you need access again
- **Request Re-invitation**: Ask to be added back to the project

**Missing After Leaving:**
- **Expected Behavior**: Project removal is intentional
- **Check Archives**: Look in archived projects if applicable
- **Contact Owner**: Request access if still needed

## Conclusion

Leaving a project is a significant action that should be taken thoughtfully. While it helps maintain a focused workspace, consider the implications for both yourself and your team. Always complete your responsibilities, transfer knowledge, and communicate clearly before leaving to ensure smooth project continuity.

If you're unsure whether to leave a project, consider alternatives like muting notifications, changing your access level, or archiving the project for future reference. These options often provide better solutions for maintaining access to important information while reducing your active involvement.
