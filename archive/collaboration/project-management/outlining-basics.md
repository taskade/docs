## What Is Outlining?

Outlining is the process of creating hierarchical structures to organize information, ideas, and tasks. It breaks complex processes into smaller, more manageable parts by establishing clear relationships between different elements.

### The Power of Hierarchical Organization

**Why outlining matters:**

- **Clarity**: Transform chaotic thoughts into structured, actionable plans
- **Focus**: Break down overwhelming projects into digestible components
- **Efficiency**: Quickly identify priorities and dependencies
- **Scalability**: Handle projects of any size with consistent organization
- **Collaboration**: Share structured information that others can easily understand

## Outlining Terminology

Taskade is a true outliner that understands relationships between outline elements. To better visualize these connections, outline elements are commonly referred to as **Parents** and **Children**.

### Parent-Child Relationships

- **Parent**: A task or item that contains other items beneath it in the hierarchy
- **Child**: A task or item that belongs to a parent item
- **Sibling**: Items at the same hierarchical level
- **Root**: The top-level item in an outline (has no parent)

### Hierarchical Levels

```
Project Title (Root)
├── Main Task 1 (Parent)
│   ├── Subtask 1.1 (Child)
│   ├── Subtask 1.2 (Child)
│   │   └── Detail 1.2.1 (Grandchild)
│   └── Subtask 1.3 (Child)
├── Main Task 2 (Parent)
│   ├── Subtask 2.1 (Child)
│   └── Subtask 2.2 (Child)
└── Main Task 3 (Parent)
```

## Basic Outlining Techniques

### Creating Hierarchies

**Building parent-child relationships:**

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Start with a Root Item
Create your main topic or project title at the top level.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Add Parent Tasks
Add main tasks or categories as direct children of the root.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Create Subtasks
Break down parent tasks into smaller, actionable subtasks.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Add Details
Include specific details, notes, or requirements as needed.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Indent/Outdent Operations

**Controlling hierarchy levels:**

- **Indent**: Move an item to become a child of the item above it
- **Outdent**: Move an item up to become a sibling of its parent
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Use `Tab` (indent) and `Shift+Tab` (outdent)
- **Drag & Drop**: Visually reorganize items by dragging them to new positions

## Fold/Unfold Functionality

Outlining gives you the power to hide or show outline levels for better focus and organization.

### Collapsing Sections

**Hide complex details to focus on the big picture:**

- **Fold**: Collapse a parent item to hide all its children
- **Unfold**: Expand a parent item to show all its children
- **Partial Expansion**: Show only certain levels of the hierarchy
- **Quick Toggle**: Use the arrow icons next to parent items

### Benefits of Folding

- **Overview Mode**: See the main structure without distractions
- **Focus**: Concentrate on specific sections of your outline
- **Navigation**: Quickly jump between different parts of large outlines
- **Presentation**: Show only relevant information to stakeholders

## Outlining Best Practices

### Structure Your Content

**Create logical hierarchies:**

1. **Start Broad**: Begin with high-level categories or main objectives
2. **Break Down**: Divide large tasks into smaller, actionable subtasks
3. **Be Consistent**: Use similar levels of detail at each hierarchy level
4. **Stay Flexible**: Be ready to reorganize as your understanding evolves

### Naming Conventions

**Use clear, descriptive names:**

- **Action-Oriented**: Start with verbs for tasks ("Create marketing plan")
- **Specific**: Include enough detail to understand the scope
- **Consistent**: Use similar naming patterns throughout your outline
- **Hierarchical**: Names should reflect their level in the hierarchy

## Advanced Outlining Techniques

### Multi-Level Hierarchies

**Handle complex projects with deep nesting:**

- **Limit Depth**: Keep hierarchies to 3-5 levels for manageability
- **Logical Grouping**: Group related items at appropriate levels
- **Cross-References**: Use links to connect related items across the hierarchy
- **Modular Design**: Break large outlines into smaller, focused sections

### Template-Based Outlining

**Use templates for consistent structures:**

- **Project Templates**: Standardized structures for common project types
- **Content Templates**: Consistent formats for articles, reports, or presentations
- **Process Templates**: Reusable workflows for recurring activities
- **Industry Templates**: Specialized structures for specific fields or domains

### Collaborative Outlining

**Work together on complex outlines:**

- **Shared Ownership**: Assign different sections to team members
- **Version Control**: Track changes and maintain outline history
- **Comments & Feedback**: Add notes and suggestions within the outline
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Work simultaneously with team members

### Integration with Other Views

**Outlining works across all project views:**

- **Board View**: Hierarchical columns and swimlanes
- **Mind Map View**: Radial hierarchy visualization
- **Calendar View**: Timeline-based hierarchies
- **Table View**: Spreadsheet-style hierarchical data

## Common Outlining Mistakes

### Over-Complexity

**Avoid these pitfalls:**

- **Too Deep**: Hierarchies with more than 5-6 levels become hard to manage
- **Inconsistent Levels**: Mixing different types of information at the same level
- **Rigid Structure**: Outlines that can't adapt to changing requirements
- **Over-Detail**: Including too much detail that obscures the main structure

### Under-Structuring

**Don't make outlines too simple:**

- **Flat Lists**: Simple lists without hierarchy lose important relationships
- **Missing Details**: Insufficient breakdown of complex tasks
- **No Prioritization**: All items appear equally important
- **Poor Organization**: Related items scattered throughout the outline

## Getting Started with Outlining
