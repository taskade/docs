# Project Progress Bar

Track the progress of your project with a visual progress bar that provides real-time insights into task completion across your entire workspace.

{% hint style="success" %}
Taskade's project progress bar gives you instant visual feedback on project status, helping you monitor completion rates and identify bottlenecks at a glance.
{% endhint %}

## Overview

The progress bar is a visual indicator that shows the completion status of your projects in real-time. Located in the top-left corner of each project, it provides an immediate overview of how much work has been completed versus what remains.

**Key Features:**
- **Real-time Updates**: Progress updates automatically as tasks are completed
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded progress bar for quick status assessment
- **Workspace Overview**: View progress for multiple projects from workspace/folder level
- **Completion Tracking**: Only checkbox tasks count toward total progress

## How Progress Tracking Works

### Automatic Calculation

Taskade automatically calculates project progress based on completed tasks:

**What Counts:**
- âœ… Completed checkboxes and tasks
- Sub-tasks marked as done
- Nested task completion

**What Doesn't Count:**
- Regular text items
- Headers and sections
- Unchecked tasks
- Comments and notes

### Progress Bar Location

**Individual Projects:**
- Located in the top-left corner of each project
- Updates in real-time as you work
- Shows percentage completion

**Workspace/Folder Level:**
- View progress bars for all projects at once
- Quick overview of multiple project statuses
- Sort by progress to identify priorities

## Using the Progress Bar Effectively

### Project Planning

Use the progress bar to:
- **Set Realistic Goals**: Plan project scope based on completion tracking
- **Monitor Milestones**: Track progress toward key deliverables
- **Identify Blockers**: Spot projects that are falling behind schedule

### Team Collaboration

Share progress insights with:
- **Stakeholders**: Provide clear visual updates on project status
- **Team Members**: Show individual contributions to overall progress
- **Clients**: Demonstrate transparency in project delivery

### Workflow Optimization

Leverage progress data to:
- **Prioritize Work**: Focus on projects with highest completion rates
- **Resource Allocation**: Identify where additional help is needed
- **Process Improvement**: Analyze completion patterns for workflow optimization

## Advanced Progress Tracking

### Custom Fields Integration

Combine progress bars with custom fields for enhanced tracking:
- Add percentage fields for manual progress updates
- Create status fields (Planning, In Progress, Completed)
- Track multiple progress metrics simultaneously

### Automation Integration

Automate progress-related workflows:
- **Completion Alerts**: Notify team when projects reach milestones
- **Status Updates**: Automatically update project status based on progress
- **Reporting**: Generate progress reports for stakeholders

## Best Practices

### Project Setup
- **Break Down Tasks**: Use checkboxes for all actionable items
- **Clear Milestones**: Structure projects with measurable completion points
- **Regular Updates**: Keep progress current with frequent task completion

### Progress Monitoring
- **Daily Check-ins**: Review progress bars during stand-ups
- **Weekly Reviews**: Analyze completion trends over time
- **Proactive Intervention**: Address stalled projects early

### Communication
- **Visual Reports**: Use progress bars in status presentations
- **Transparent Updates**: Share progress with all stakeholders
- **Celebrate Milestones**: Recognize achievements at key completion points

## Troubleshooting

### Progress Not Updating
- Ensure tasks are marked with checkboxes, not just text
- Check that completed tasks are properly checked off
- Refresh the page if progress seems stuck

### Inaccurate Progress
- Review task structure to ensure proper nesting
- Verify that all actionable items are checkboxes
- Consider if some tasks should be broken down further

### Performance Issues
- Large projects may take time to calculate progress
- Consider breaking very large projects into smaller ones
- Use workspace-level view for overview instead of individual project views

## Integration with Other Features

### Project Views
- **Board View**: Visual progress representation with cards
- **Calendar View**: Time-based progress tracking
- **Mind Map View**: Hierarchical progress visualization

### Automation
- **Progress Triggers**: Create automations based on progress milestones
- **Notification Rules**: Alert team members at specific completion percentages
- **Workflow Integration**: Connect progress updates to external systems

### Reporting
- **Export Progress**: Include progress data in project exports
- **Dashboard Creation**: Build custom dashboards with progress metrics
- **Historical Tracking**: Review progress trends over time

## Conclusion

The project progress bar is more than just a visual indicatorâ€”it's a powerful tool for project management, team collaboration, and workflow optimization. By providing real-time insights into project completion, it helps teams stay organized, meet deadlines, and maintain momentum toward their goals.
