## Overview

Taskade provides a complete project lifecycle management system that allows you to:
- **Complete** projects when finished

- Included in all searches and filters
- Accessible to all team members
- Appear in recent projects and activity feeds

### Completed Projects
**Projects marked as finished:**
- Moved to completed projects section
- Still accessible but not in main workspace view
- Preserved with all data and history
- Can be restored if needed

### Deleted Projects
**Permanently removed projects:**
- Cannot be restored
- All data permanently deleted
- Removed from all searches and filters
- Space freed up in workspace

## Best Practices

### When to Complete vs. Delete

**Complete projects when:**
- **Work is finished** but may be referenced later
- **Projects contain valuable data** or templates
- **Team needs access** to completed work for future reference
- **Projects serve as examples** for similar future work

**Delete projects when:**
- **Content is obsolete** and no longer relevant
- **Projects contain sensitive data** that should be removed
- **Workspace cleanup** is needed to reduce clutter
- **Projects were test/demo** work with no lasting value

### Project Completion Workflow

**Establish a consistent completion process:**

1. **Final Review**: Ensure all tasks are completed and documented
2. **Data Cleanup**: Remove sensitive information if needed
3. **Archive Important Elements**: Save templates, processes, or key learnings
4. **Team Notification**: Inform stakeholders of project completion
5. **Mark Complete**: Use appropriate completion method

### Organization Strategies

**Maintain clean workspaces:**

**Regular Cleanup:**
- Review completed projects monthly
- Delete truly obsolete projects
- Archive important completed work
- Maintain workspace size limits

**Naming Conventions:**
- Include completion dates in project names
- Use status indicators (e.g., "Q4 2024 - Completed")
- Tag projects by completion status

**Team Communication:**
- Set expectations for project lifecycle
- Train team on completion vs. deletion
- Establish shared cleanup schedules

## Automation Integration

### Project Completion Triggers

**Automate actions when projects are completed:**

- **Send completion notifications** to stakeholders
- **Create follow-up tasks** for review or documentation
- **Archive project data** to external systems
- **Update project status** in connected tools

### Scheduled Cleanup

**Set up automated project management:**

- **Auto-complete** projects past due dates
- **Send reminders** for long-inactive projects
- **Generate reports** on project completion rates
- **Trigger reviews** for projects nearing deadlines

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Can't find completed projects:**
- Check the correct workspace
- Ensure you're looking in "Completed Projects" section
- Verify project wasn't permanently deleted

**Project won't complete:**
- Check user permissions for the workspace
- Ensure project isn't locked or in use
- Try refreshing the page

**Bulk operations not working:**
- Verify all selected projects are in the same state
- Check for permission differences across projects
- Try individual operations if bulk fails

### Recovery Options

**If you accidentally complete a project:**
- Immediately restore from completed projects section
- No data is lost in the completion process

**If you accidentally delete a project:**
- Contact Taskade support immediately
- Recovery may be possible within a short time window
- Always consider completion before deletion

## Data Preservation

### What Gets Preserved

**When completing projects:**
- ✅ All project content and structure
- ✅ Task details, comments, and attachments
- ✅ Project history and version data
- ✅ Team member assignments and permissions
- ✅ Custom fields and metadata

**When deleting projects:**
- ❌ All project data permanently removed
- ❌ Task history and comments deleted
- ❌ Attachments and media files removed
- ❌ Project references in automations broken

### Backup Considerations

**Before deleting projects:**
- **Export important data** using available export options
- **Save templates** if project structure is reusable
- **Document key learnings** or processes
- **Archive attachments** if they contain valuable assets

## Integration with Other Features

### Project Templates

**Save completed projects as templates:**
- Create reusable project structures
- Preserve successful workflows
- Share best practices across teams

### Reporting and Analytics

**Track project lifecycle metrics:**
- Completion rates and timelines
- Project success patterns
- Team productivity insights
- Cleanup and maintenance schedules

### Workspace Organization

**Use completion status for organization:**
- Separate active from completed work
- Create workspace-specific completion policies
- Implement team-specific archiving procedures

## Conclusion

Effective project lifecycle management is essential for maintaining productive, organized workspaces. By understanding when to complete, archive, restore, or delete projects, you can:

- **Keep workspaces focused** on active work
- **Preserve access** to completed projects when needed
- **Free up resources** by removing obsolete content
- **Maintain team productivity** through clean organization
- **Ensure data security** through appropriate deletion practices
