{% endhint %}

## Overview

Taskade provides powerful tools to organize and manage your projects through:
- **Copying** projects to create duplicates for reuse
- **Duplicating** projects within the same workspace
- **Moving** projects between workspaces and folders

These features help you maintain clean, organized workspaces while enabling efficient project management and collaboration.

## Understanding Copy vs. Duplicate

In Taskade, copying and duplicating are essentially the same operation - both create a complete copy of a project. The difference is in naming and context:

- **Copy**: Creates a duplicate that can be placed in any workspace or folder
- **Duplicate**: Creates a duplicate within the same workspace/folder (conceptually similar but implementation is identical)

Both operations preserve all project content, structure, tasks, comments, attachments, and custom fields.

## Copying Projects

### Method 1: Quick Copy from Project List

**Copy projects directly from the workspace view:**

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Access Project Menu
Hover over the project in the workspace list and click the **three dots (···)** on the right.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Select Copy Option
Choose **Copy** from the dropdown menu.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Configure Copy Settings
- **Rename** the project (optional)
- **Select destination** workspace or folder
- **Confirm** the copy operation
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Project Copied
The copied project appears in the selected location with "(Copy)" appended to the name.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Method 2: Copy from Within Project

**Copy a project while working inside it:**

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Open the Project
Navigate to the project you want to copy.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Access Project Menu
Click the **three dots (···)** in the top-right corner of the project.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Select Copy
Choose **Copy** from the dropdown menu.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Choose Destination
Select the target workspace or folder for the copied project.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Duplicating Projects

### Quick Duplicate in Same Location

**Create a duplicate within the current workspace or folder:**

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Access Project Menu
Hover over the project and click the **three dots (···)**.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Select Duplicate
Choose **Duplicate** from the menu (this works the same as Copy but keeps it in the same location).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Project Duplicated
A new project appears with "(Copy)" appended to the original name.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Bulk Copy/Duplicate Operations

**Copy or duplicate multiple projects at once:**

1. **Hold Ctrl/Cmd** and click to select multiple projects
2. **Right-click** on any selected project
3. **Choose "Copy Projects"** or **"Duplicate Projects"** from the context menu
4. **Select destination** (for copy operations)
5. **Confirm** the bulk operation

## Moving Projects

### Method 1: Drag-and-Drop Movement

**Move projects using intuitive drag-and-drop:**

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Select Project
Click and hold on any project in the workspace list.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Drag to Destination
Drag the project to the target workspace or folder in the left sidebar.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Release to Complete
Release the mouse button to complete the move operation.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Project Moved
The project appears in its new location and disappears from the original location.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Method 2: Menu-Based Movement

**Move projects using the project menu:**

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Access Project Menu
Hover over the project and click the **three dots (···)**.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Select Move Option
Choose **Move** from the dropdown menu.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Choose Destination
Select the target workspace or folder from the dialog.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Confirm Movement
Click **Move** to complete the operation.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Bulk Project Movement

**Move multiple projects simultaneously:**

1. **Select multiple projects** using Ctrl/Cmd + click
2. **Right-click** on any selected project
3. **Choose "Move Projects"** from the context menu
4. **Select destination** workspace or folder
5. **Confirm** the bulk move operation

## What Gets Copied/Duplicated

### Complete Project Content
- ✅ **Project structure** and hierarchy
- ✅ **All tasks** and subtasks
- ✅ **Task details** (descriptions, due dates, assignees)
- ✅ **Comments** and discussion threads
- ✅ **Attachments** and media files
- ✅ **Custom fields** and metadata
- ✅ **Project settings** and configurations

### Preserved Relationships
- ✅ **Task dependencies** and relationships
- ✅ **Custom field values** and configurations
- ✅ **Project templates** and automation settings
- ✅ **Sharing permissions** (if applicable)
- ✅ **Project history** and version information

### What Changes in Copies
- 🔄 **Project name** gets "(Copy)" suffix
- 🔄 **Unique identifiers** are regenerated
- 🔄 **Timestamps** are updated to copy time
- 🔄 **Sharing links** become unique
- 🔄 **Automation triggers** may need reconfiguration

## Use Cases and Best Practices

### Template Creation

**Create reusable project templates:**

1. **Build a perfect project structure** with all necessary tasks, custom fields, and automations
2. **Copy the project** to create template instances
3. **Customize each copy** for specific use cases
4. **Maintain template** as master copy for future duplication

**Example:** Create a "Client Onboarding" template that you copy for each new client.

### Team Collaboration

**Share project structures across teams:**

1. **Develop project frameworks** in one workspace
2. **Copy projects** to team-specific workspaces
3. **Customize copies** for team-specific needs
4. **Maintain consistency** across similar projects

**Example:** Copy a "Sprint Planning" project to each development team's workspace.

### Project Scaling

**Scale successful project approaches:**

1. **Identify successful project structures**
2. **Copy proven frameworks** for new initiatives
3. **Adapt copies** to new requirements
4. **Track performance** across similar projects

**Example:** Copy a successful "Product Launch" project for new product releases.

### Workspace Organization

**Maintain clean workspace structure:**

1. **Move completed projects** to archive workspaces
2. **Copy active projects** to team workspaces
3. **Duplicate templates** for new work streams
4. **Consolidate related projects** into folders

**Example:** Move Q4 projects to an "Archive" workspace, copy active projects to team folders.

## Advanced Scenarios

### Cross-Workspace Collaboration

**Share project structures between organizations:**

- **Copy projects** between workspaces you own
- **Move projects** to reorganize workspace structure
- **Duplicate projects** for parallel development streams
- **Maintain templates** in dedicated template workspaces

### Version Control

**Manage project versions:**

- **Copy projects** to create version snapshots
- **Move archived versions** to history workspaces
- **Duplicate working copies** for experimentation
- **Maintain master templates** for consistency

### Integration with Templates

**Combine with template features:**

- **Save copied projects as formal templates**
- **Use template gallery** for organization-wide sharing
- **Apply templates** then customize with copies
- **Version control** template evolution

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Copy/Duplicate fails:**
- Check available storage space
- Verify workspace permissions
- Ensure destination workspace exists
- Try individual operations if bulk fails

**Move operation stalls:**
- Check internet connection stability
- Verify permissions in both workspaces
- Ensure project isn't currently being edited
- Try menu-based move instead of drag-and-drop

**Missing content in copies:**
- Attachments may take time to copy
- Large projects may need more time
- Check copy progress in notifications
- Refresh destination workspace

### Recovery Options

**If copy/duplicate fails:**
- Retry the operation
- Try copying smaller portions
- Check system status notifications
- Contact support for large projects

**If move fails:**
- Project remains in original location
- Retry the move operation
- Use alternative move method
- Check workspace capacity limits

## Performance Considerations

### Large Project Handling

**Optimize for large projects:**
