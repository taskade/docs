My tasks are not showing on the Roadmap. What can I do?

Troubleshoot issues with tasks not appearing on the roadmap.

Updated over a year ago

Only Projects with due dates are visible on the Roadmap. Tasks with due dates **won't show up on the Roadmap** but you can still see them in the üóìÔ∏è [Taskade Calendar](https://intercom.help/taskade/en/articles/8958375) and the [‚úÖ My Tasks](https://intercom.help/taskade/en/articles/8958383) dashboard.

**üí° Note**:Visit [Add to Roadmap](https://intercom.help/taskade/en/articles/8958506) for more tips on using the Roadmap feature.
