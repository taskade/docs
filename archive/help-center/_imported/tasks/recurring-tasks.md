# **Overview**Recurring tasks allow you to set tasks to repeat at specific intervals. When a task is set to recur, a new instance will appear only after the current one is marked as complete. You can choose from preset intervals or set a custom schedule.

# **Set Recurring Tasks**[Create a project](https://intercom.help/taskade/en/articles/8958370) and add the task you want to repeat.
​

Click the ➕ button next to a task and select [🗓️ Due Date](https://intercom.help/taskade/en/articles/8958507).
​

Set the time, and frequency (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly).
​

If you do not choose a time for the task, you will receive a reminder at midnight.

💡 **Note**: The next repetition of a recurring task will only appear in the project when the current task has been completed.
