You've deleted your projects but for some reason they are still showing up in your search menu and their tasks are still appearing in the My Task tab. This is caused by the projects index not being updated and here are some steps you can try to get rid of these ghost/phantom projects.

* * *

**Transfer Ownership**
----------------------

1.   Following these steps to [Transfer Ownership](https://intercom.help/taskade/en/articles/8958656) of the workspace which contains these ghost projects to another user. This second user can your friend/teammates or a second account. 
2.   Leave the workspace. 
3.   Get the second user to invite you back into the workspace. 
4.   Check if the projects and tasks have been updated correctly. 

* * *

Missing Folders
---------------

If you have followed the above steps and now have missing folders after you rejoined the workspace, get the **second user** to follow these steps to gain them back.

1.   Open **Workspace Settings** 
2.   Click on the **Folder Section** 
3.   Click on the folders that are "missing" and click **Join as Owner** 
4.   Navigate to that folder and then **re-share** the folder back to the original account
