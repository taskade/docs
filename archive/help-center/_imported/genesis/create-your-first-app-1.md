4 Steps to a Live App
---------------------

Getting your app off the ground is really simple. Follow these four steps to transform any challenge into working solution that works out of the box.

**Step 1: Start with Your Idea**
--------------------------------

The best apps solve real problems in your business. Before you even open Genesis, think about what's slowing you down or what could work better.

Ask yourself:

Do you already have your answers? Great! Let's move to the next step.

**Step 2: Let Genesis Build It**
--------------------------------

When you first open Genesis, you'll see a text area where you can describe what you want to create, along with a few additional options below:

Since you already know what problem you want to solve, simply describe it as you would to a colleague. The more specific you are, the better the result.

**Step 3: Test and Iterate**
----------------------------

Once Genesis builds your initial app, you'll see it come to life with all the professional features you need. But this is just the beginning. Now you can refine it.

Switch to the **Preview** tab to interact with your live application.
