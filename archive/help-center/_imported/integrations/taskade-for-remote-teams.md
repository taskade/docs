Keep your remote team on the same page with Taskade's collaboration features.

Updated over a year ago

Managing a remote team comes with its own set of challenges‚Äîcommunication gaps, coordination issues, and keeping everyone on the same page. Taskade is here to make remote work smoother, more connected, and productive by providing the tools your team needs to work together effectively, no matter where they are.

Here are a few tips & tricks that will help you get started. üëá

Why Taskade Is Perfect for Your Remote Team
-------------------------------------------

Setting Up Your Remote Team Workspace
-------------------------------------

Let‚Äôs start by creating a dedicated workspace for your remote team. This will be your central hub where everything happens. Then, we‚Äôll organize it with folders.

### Step 1: Create a Shared Workspace

### Step: 2 Add Folders

You can use folders to categorize different aspects of your team's workflow.

There are many ways to organize a workspace with folders. Here is some inspiration:

### Scenario 1: Project-Centric Organization

If your team works on multiple projects simultaneously, this structure will ensure that everything related to a specific project is neatly grouped together.

**üóÇÔ∏è Folder Name****üî§ Description**
**Project Alpha**Store all tasks, timelines, files, and updates for Project Alpha.
**Project Beta**Everything related to Project Beta, including milestones and docs.
**Project Gamma**Keep tasks, reports, and communication for Project Gamma here.
**Design & Assets**Centralized folder for design files and visual assets across projects.
**Client Communications**Logs of all client interactions and feedback for easy reference.

### Scenario 2: Area-Centric Organization

This structure is ideal if your team is organized around specific roles or areas of responsibility, with each group focusing on different aspects of the work.

**üóÇÔ∏è Folder Name****üî§ Description**
**Product Development**Store tasks, documents, and progress updates for the dev team.
**Marketing & Outreach**Organize campaigns, content, and social media strategies.
**Customer Support**Keep logs of customer queries, support tickets, and responses.
**Operations & Admin**Centralized folder for HR, finance, and administrative tasks.
**General Resources**Share team-wide resources, like guidelines, templates, and policies.

Start a Call with Your Team
---------------------------

Remote work doesn‚Äôt mean you have to lose the personal touch of face-to-face communication. With Taskade‚Äôs built-in video and voice call features, you can easily start a call with your team directly within the app.

Automate Your Remote Team's Workflow

The Automation feature will help keep your team aligned and productive with less manual work, no matter where your team is located.
