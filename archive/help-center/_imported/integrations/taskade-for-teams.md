**Overview**
------------

If you're exploring Taskade for the first time or looking to get more out of it for your team, this guide is for you. There are several ways you can set up your Taskade workspace to suit your team's needs.

1.   One workspace for each department. Separate folders for specific functions.

​ 
2.   One workspace for your entire team. Separate folders for each department.

​ 
3.   One workspace for your entire team. Separate folders for each function.

​ 

**💡 Note**: These are just some of the ways you can organize your team in Taskade.

**Key Taskade Terminology**
---------------------------

Before we dive in, let's review some key terms we're going to use:

*   [Workspace](https://intercom.help/taskade/en/articles/8958483)**:** Collection of folders, projects, and templates.

​ 
*   [Folder](https://intercom.help/taskade/en/articles/8958495)**:** A collection of projects, and templates nested within a workspace.

​ 
*   [Project](https://intercom.help/taskade/en/articles/8958370)**:** A digital canvas where you can chat and collaborate with your team. 

Think of each level as a puzzle piece that fits into the big picture of [Taskade's structure](https://intercom.help/taskade/en/articles/8958376).

Alright, now that that's out of the way, let's dive into the setups.

* * *

**Method 1: A Workspace for Each Department**
---------------------------------------------

In this setup, you're going to do the following:

1.   Create a separate workspace for each department.

​ 
2.   In each workspace, create folders for functions within that department.

​ 
3.   Invite each team member into their respective workspaces and folders.

​ 
4.   Create projects related to the functions of each folder.

​ 
5.   Invite team members from a different department to a project. 

**🧩 Example**: Let's say there are four departments in your team: Marketing, Human Resources, Accounting, and Engineering. I'd create a workspace for each one and create folders for each of their functions. So, Marketing gets a workspace, as does Human Resources, Accounting, and Engineering.

**🟡 Marketing****🔵 HR****🟠 Accounting****🟣 Engineering**
Home Folder (Default)Home Folder (Default)Home Folder (Default)Home Folder (Default)
Meetings Performance Reviews Accounts Payable Meetings
............

**Ideal For:**

*   Medium to large organizations

​ 
*   Specialized teams

​ 
*   Functional organizational structures

​ 
*   Divisional structures 

**When to Use This Setup**

*   When team members don't collaborate with teams from other departments.

​ 
*   When team functions are unique to each department.

​ 
*   When team roles and responsibilities don't overlap.
