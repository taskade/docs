# **Overview**Genesis Version History automatically tracks every change you make to your Genesis apps. You can view the previous versions, see what changed when, and restore your app to a previous state when things break. Here's how it works.

**ðŸ’¡ Note**: Visit [this](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958423-version-history) article if you're looking for Project version history.

# What Is TrackedEvery time you modify your app, Genesis saves a snapshot so you can always go back to what was working and iterate on your design.
