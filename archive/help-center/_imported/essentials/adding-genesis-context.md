# **Overview**When you build apps with Genesis, you can upload reference files to provide context and guidance. The additional context will help Genesis understand your requirements, match your brand, and follow a specific design pattern.

**ðŸ’¡ Note**: Any files that you upload to the [TAA chat](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958449-taskade-assistant-agent-taa) are added to the [Media tab](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958461-media-tab).

# **What You Can Use as Context**Genesis works with various file types to understand your requirements. Upload documents, images, data files, and code samples to amplify your builds.

## **Brand and Design Files**Upload your visual identity materials so Genesis can match your brand perfectly.

**Brand guidelines (PDF):** Color codes, typography, logo usage, design principles
â€‹

**Logo files (PNG, JPG):** Primary logos, variations, icons, and brand marks
â€‹

**Color palettes and style guides:** Hex codes, color combinations, visual hierarchy
â€‹

**Website screenshots** Current site design, layout patterns, UI elements
â€‹

**Mockups or wireframes:** App layouts, user interface designs, navigation flows

## **Data and Structure Files**Share examples of data and processes to better explain your use case.

**Existing forms (PDF):** Contact forms, registration forms, surveys, applications
â€‹

**Data examples:** Table structures, field definitions, sample records
â€‹

**Workflow documents:** Process flows, SOPs, business rules
â€‹

**Code snippets:** Validation rules, integration examples, custom functions

## **Reference Materials**Show Genesis examples of what you like or want to replicate from other sources.

**Screenshots of apps:** UI inspiration, feature examples, interaction patterns
â€‹

**Screenshots existing systems:** Legacy applications, competitor tools
â€‹

**Process documentation:** Standard procedures, user manuals, training materials

**User requirements:** Feature specifications, acceptance criteria, use cases
â€‹

# **Provide App Context**There are two different ways to provide context to Genesis depending on when you're in the app building process. Here's how to get started:

## **Initial Prompt**When you first prompt Genesis to build an app, you can provide text-based context. Paste relevant information directly into your initial prompt.

**Open Genesis** and **type** your initial **app** **prompt**.
â€‹

**Paste text context** like color codes, field lists, requirements, or code snippets.
â€‹

**Submit the prompt**. Genesis will create the app using your text context.

**Example:**

"Build a contact form with these fields: Name (required), Email (required), Phone (optional), Company, Message. Use these brand colors: Primary #1e3a8a, Secondary #f97316."

## **Follow-Up Prompts**After Genesis creates your app, you can upload context files in follow-up prompts to refine and improve the app. Uploaded files will be added to the [Media tab](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958461-media-tab).

**Open your Genesis app** in Preview mode after it's created.
â€‹

**Upload context files**:
â€‹

(method 1) **Drag** &amp; **drop** files into the **TAA chat window**.
â€‹

(method 2) Use the **Attachment** **button** (ðŸ“Ž)

**Ask Genesis to update the app** using the new context.

**Example**:

"Update this contact form to match our brand guidelines. Use the colors and fonts specified in the uploaded PDF. Apply our logo to the header."
