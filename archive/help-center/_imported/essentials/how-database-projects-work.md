# **Overview**When Genesis creates an app, it automatically generates database projects that serve as your app's data layer. Those databases are perfect for apps like:

Customer portals with client data and project history
â€‹

Booking systems with appointments and customer records
â€‹

Inventory apps with product catalogs and stock levels
â€‹

CRM applications with leads, contacts, and sales data

ðŸ’¡ **Note**: Database projects default to [the Table view](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958389-table-view) for easy data management, but you can [switch between views](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958384-what-are-project-views) at any time.

# **Using Database Projects**Genesis apps use database projects for:

Smart data structure automatically created based on your app's needs
â€‹

Real-time synchronization between your app interface and database
â€‹

AI-powered insights from [agents trained on your  data](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958457-custom-ai-agents)
â€‹

[Automated workflows](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958467-getting-started-with-automation) that respond to the actions within the app

Your workspaces and project become the single source of truth.

# **Data Management**## **Genesis-Generated Databases**When you create an app, Genesis automatically builds the required projects:

Describe your app needs to Genesis in plain English.
â€‹

Genesis analyzes your requirements and generates projects to store data.
â€‹

[Custom fields and relationships](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/9767679-custom-fields) are automatically configured.
â€‹

Your app launches with a fully functional database backend

You can also request a specific data structure in your prompts:

- "Create a yoga studio booking app with a customer database, class schedule database, and instructor database."
- "Build a client portal for our agency with a client database, project database, and invoice database."
- "Make an inventory management system with a product database, supplier database, and order database."

## **Manual Database Creation**Here's how to add new database projects to existing apps:

**Open your app** in Taskade
â€‹

**Click + New Project** within the app's [dashboard view](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/11967139-a-guide-to-the-new-ui).
â€‹

Choose a template, ask Taskade to generate a project, or start blank.
â€‹

Configure custom fields inside the project.
â€‹

Ask Genesis to connect to connect the database to the app.

## **Importing Data into App Databases**Transform existing business data into app-ready databases:

Navigate to your app's dashboard.
â€‹

Got to **Projects â†’ Import** â†’ **Import CSV**.
â€‹

**Upload your file** (CSV, Excel, Google Sheets).
â€‹

**Ask Genesis** to use connect the database and adjust the custom fields.

# **App Database Automation**## **Automated App Workflows**Your app's database projects can trigger intelligent workflows.

For example, you can prompt Genesis in the chat to create:

### **Booking App Automations**When appointment status â†’ "Confirmed" â†’ Send reminder email
â€‹

When new booking â†’ Created â†’ Notify staff and block calendar
â€‹

When payment â†’ "Received" â†’ Update booking status and send receipt

### **CRM App Automations**When lead score â†’ Above 80 â†’ Assign to sales rep and create follow-up task
â€‹

When deal stage â†’ "Proposal Sent" â†’ Set 7-day follow-up reminder
â€‹

When client â†’ "Inactive for 30 days" â†’ Trigger re-engagement campaign

### **Inventory App Automations**When stock level â†’ Below minimum â†’ Create purchase order
â€‹

When new product â†’ Added â†’ Update catalog and notify sales team
â€‹

When order â†’ "Shipped" â†’ Send tracking info to customer

These are just a handful of examples of what can be accomplished with automation flows. Experiment, try different approaches, and build your perfect setup!

## AI Agents in App DatabasesYour app's [custom AI agents](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958457-custom-ai-agents) can work directly with database data. Simply ask Genesis to [generate a new AI agent](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958457-custom-ai-agents#h_1b24d10499) specifically for your app.
