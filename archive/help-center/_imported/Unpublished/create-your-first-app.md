What Is Taskade Genesis?

Genesis is an AI app builder that creates complete business applications from a single prompt. You describe what you need, and Genesis builds a working app in minutes. Not a mockup or prototype, but fully functional software.

Unlike other app builders, Genesis gives you:

- Project knowledge (databases where apps store and retrieve information from)
​

- Automation workflows that take care of the boring stuff for you

- Trainable AI agents you can embed directly in your apps
​

- Powerful integrations that work out of the box and connect your digital world

This guide will walk you through creating your first professional app using Taskade Genesis. If you can explain a business problem, you can build an app to solve it!

4 Steps to a Live App

Getting your app off the ground is really simple. Follow these four steps to transform any challenge into working solution that works out of the box.

Step 1: Start with Your Idea

The best apps solve real problems in your business. Before you even open Genesis, think about what's slowing you down or what could work better.

Ask yourself:

- What manual process takes too much time?
​

- Where do I lose track of important information?
​

- What would make my customers' experience smoother?
​

- Which tasks could my team handle more efficiently?

Do you already have your answers? Great! Let's move to the next step.

Step 2: Let Genesis Build It

When you first open Genesis, you'll see a text area where you can describe what you want to create, along with a few additional options below:

- Model Selector: Choose which AI model to use for generating your app.
​

- Prompt Library: Access pre-built prompt templates for common app types.
​

- Prompt Enhancement: Get AI-powered suggestions to improve your prompt.
​

- Default Prompts: Quick-start templates for popular app categories.
​

- ➕ New App Button: The primary action button to generate a new app.
​

- App Gallery: Browse and explore previously created apps.

Since you already know what problem you want to solve, simply describe it as you would to a colleague. The more specific you are, the better the result.

💡 Note: Focus on your business need or the problem you're trying to solve, not the technical implementation. Genesis handles the complexity.

Step 3: Test and Iterate

Once Genesis builds your initial app, you'll see it come to life with all the professional features you need. But this is just the beginning. Now you can refine it.

Switch to the Preview tab to interact with your live application.

Test the core functionality:

- Navigate through the user flow as your customers would
​

- Try submitting forms and entering data
​

- Check how it looks on your phone or tablet
​

- Verify that notifications and automations work as expected

Now make it uniquely yours.

Making changes is simple. Just describe what you want to adjust. Genesis understands business language and implements changes immediately.

- [Connect to your existing tools]($1):

- `"Send notifications to our team Slack channel."`
​

- Match your brand:

- `"Use our company colors." or "Make the logo more prominent."`
​

- Fine-tune the experience:

- `"Add a confirmation message after submission" or "Include progress indicators for multi-step processes."
​`

- Adjust permissions:

- `"Only team leads should access the analytics dashboard." or "Let clients edit their own information."`

💡 Pro tip: Make one change at a time and test it before moving to the next. This way you can see exactly how each modification improves the user experience.

Step 4: Share It!

Your app is ready for the real world! You've built something that solves a real business problem, and now it's time to put it in front of actual users.

Getting it live is simple:

- Publish: Click Publish in the top-right corner. Once this is done:
​

- (2) Copy the direct app link or share your app on social media.
​

- (3) Embed the app on your website or blog.
​

- (4) Share the app on your social media.

Your app is instantly available and ready for users!

Share your success story and get featured:

- Post about your creation on LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit, or your favorite platform.
​

- Show before/after: "I had this business problem, now I have this solution."
​
