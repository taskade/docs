Overview

Genesis Version History automatically tracks every change you make to your Genesis apps. You can view the previous versions, see what changed when, and restore your app to a previous state when things break. Here's how it works.

ðŸ’¡ Note: Visit [this]($1) article if you're looking for Project version history.

What Is Tracked

Every time you modify your app, Genesis saves a snapshot so you can always go back to what was working and iterate on your design.

- Content modifications and updates
â€‹

- Configuration changes and settings
â€‹

- Feature additions and removals
â€‹

- Design and styling updates
â€‹

- Integration and automation changes

View &amp; Restore App Versions

When you need to undo changes or your app breaks after an update, you can restore a version in seconds. Your current version is saved automatically.

- Open your Genesis app in the workspace.
â€‹

- Click Restore Version in the top-right corner.

- Choose the version of your app your want to restore.
â€‹

- Click Restore Version at the bottom of the list.
