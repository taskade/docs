Overview

Once you've built an amazing app with Genesis, you can share it with others in different ways. Whether you want to publish it for everyone to use, let others clone your entire workflow, or simply share a template, we've got you covered.

Publish Your App

Publishing makes your app available to anyone with the link.

- Click the Publish button in the top-right corner of your app.
â€‹

- Choose your visibility settings (scroll down for details):
â€‹

- Public: Anyone can find and use your app.
â€‹

- Private: Only people with the direct link can access your app.
â€‹

- Your app is instantly available at a unique URL.
â€‹

- Share the link via email, social media, or embed it on your website.

What "Publish" Means

Once published, your app gets:

- A live, shareable URL that works on any device
â€‹

- Real-time functionality for all users
â€‹

- Powered by your own Taskade [workspace]($1)

Unpublish Your App

You can always update your published app by making changes.

The same URL stays active, so your users never lose access.

To unpublish an app:

- Go to the Publish menu again.
â€‹

- Click Unpublish app at the bottom of the pop-up.
â€‹

- The app will no longer be accessible to others.

App Visibility Settings

You have two main options for how people can access your app:

Public Apps

- Anyone can discover and use your app
â€‹

- Your app may be featured in the community gallery
â€‹

- Perfect for apps you want to share widely
â€‹

- Can be submitted as templates for others to clone

Private Apps

- Only accessible via the direct link you share
â€‹

- Won't appear in public galleries
â€‹

- Great for internal team tools or client-specific applications
â€‹

- You control exactly who gets access

Cloning Apps

Cloning is different from just using an app. When you clone an app, you create a complete copy of the app and all its connected parts in someone else's workspace.

ðŸ’¡ Note: Think of cloning as sharing the blueprint and building materials.

To enable the cloning feature for your app:

- Click Publish â†’ Share a template link.

- Others can now open the URL and click "Clone App".

- They choose a name and workspace for their copy.
â€‹

- Select a color to personalize the new app space.

When to Use Templates

Template links transfer your entire workflow. Share them when you want someone to:

- Build upon your app idea.
â€‹

- Learn from your automation setup.
â€‹

- Create their own version for their business.
â€‹

- Use your app as a starting point for something new.

ðŸ’¡ Note: Any changes made to the original app won't affect cloned copies, and vice versa. Each clone becomes an independent app.

What Gets Cloned

When someone clones your app, they get:

- The complete app structure and design
â€‹

- All connected projects and data templates
â€‹

- Automation workflows
â€‹

- AI agent configurations
â€‹

- Media files and assets

Sharing vs. Cloning

Understanding the difference helps you choose the right approach:

Share a Published Link

- You want people to use your app as-is.
â€‹

- You're providing a service or tool to customers.
â€‹

- You want to collect data in your system.
â€‹

- You need to maintain control and see all activity.

Share a Template Link

- You want people to build their own version.
â€‹

- You're sharing a workflow or process template.
â€‹

- You want others to learn from your setup.
â€‹

- You're contributing to the community.

App Sharing Best Practices

For Public Apps

- Use clear, descriptive names.
â€‹

- Test thoroughly before publishing.
â€‹

- Include helpful instructions within the app.
â€‹

- Consider adding contact information for support.

For Template Sharing

- Document your automation workflows.
â€‹

- Use descriptive project names.
â€‹

- Include sample data to help others understand the structure.
â€‹

- Consider creating a brief guide explaining how to customize.

Security Considerations

- Only publish apps that don't contain sensitive information.
â€‹

- Use private links for internal or confidential applications.
â€‹

- Remember that public apps can be discovered by anyone.
â€‹

- Template links share your entire workflow structure.

Getting Started

Ready to share your creation with the world?

- Start with preview. Test your app thoroughly first.
â€‹

- Choose sharing method. Publish for users, or create template links for builders.
â€‹

- Set appropriate visibility. Public for wide sharing, private for controlled access.
â€‹

- Share and celebrate. Your app is now helping others solve problems.

ðŸ’¡ Note: Remember, every app you share makes the Genesis community stronger and helps other builders solve real business challenges.

Troubleshooting

- App won't publish? Make sure your app is running properly in preview mode first. If you see a "Resume" message, click it to start your app.
â€‹

- Can't find the template link? Template links are separate from publish links. Look for "Copy Template Link" in the Publish menu.
