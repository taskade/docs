The Webflow integration lets you enhance your communication and workflow automation by seamlessly linking your email activities with tasks and projects.

**Webflow Automation**
----------------------

Connecting Taskade with Webflow allows you to automate tasks based on new form submissions on your website. When a visitor submits a form, Taskade can automatically trigger actions such as creating tasks, updating projects, or notifying your team.
