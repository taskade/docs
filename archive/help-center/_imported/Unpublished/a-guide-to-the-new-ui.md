What Is Taskade Genesis?

Genesis is an AI app builder that generates complete business applications from a single prompt. Just describe what you need, and Genesis will create it for you.

💡 Note: Want to start building apps? Visit our [Genesis Quick Start Guide]($1) first.

Meet the new Interface

Along with new capability comes the most significant UI overhaul in Taskade’s history. You'll notice major changes in how you navigate between your spaces.

If you're familiar with the previous layout, we’ll walk you through everything that’s changed and help you get comfortable in the new environment.

💡 Note: Don’t worry, your existing Teams/Folders/Subspaces are still there. They now appear as tiles beneath the input box, so you can easily access everything in one place while keeping the focus on building with AI.

Breadcrumbs

We’ve introduced breadcrumbs across all screens to make navigation faster and more intuitive. Each breadcrumb represents a level in your navigation history.

Click on any part of the trail to jump directly to that section:

- Taskade Logo: Go back to the highest level and view your recent projects.
​

- Workspace Name: Takes you back to your workspace overview.
​

- Current Location: Shows the active subspace (like "Marketing Tasks (Week 1)").
​

- When available, each breadcrumb item includes additional options.
​

- For Workspaces and Apps, you’ll see a dropdown for quick switching.
​

- Space Menu: Return to a high-level overview of your:
​

- 🗂️ [Projects]($1)
​

- 🤖 [Agents
​]($1)

- 👥 [AI Teams]($1)
​

- 🔄 [Automations]($1)
​

- 🖼️ [Media]($1)
​

- 🪄 [AI Kits]($1)
​

- View the active project.

New Starting Point

The main workspace landing page now features the Genesis input field in the center. Simply enter a prompt, and the AI will generate a complete app for you.

The Genesis interface features a few key sections:

- Model Selector: Choose which AI model to use for generating your app.
​

- Prompt Library: Access pre-built prompt templates for common app types.
​

- Prompt Enhancement: Get AI-powered suggestions to improve your prompt.
​

- Default Prompts: Quick-start templates for popular app categories.
​

- ➕ New App Button: The primary action button to generate a new app.
​

- App Gallery: Browse and explore previously created apps.

Workspace Settings

You can find Workspace Settings by clicking the three dots ··· next workspace name:

App Settings

For Apps, the triple-dot icon ··· appears when you hover over the app tile:

Teams &amp; Folders Are “Apps”

We’ve renamed Teams/Folders/Subspaces — they’re now called Apps.

Spaces function the same way as before in terms of organization, but there’s one key difference: every App now includes a Preview tab that displays the user interface.

New Workspace Layout

Home Space

The Home space of your Workspace is now divided into two parts:

- The left panel features the new [Taskade Assistant Agent (TAA)]($1).

- The right panel is where you interact with your:
​

- Projects
​

- Agents
​

- Automations
​

- Apps

Workspace Controls

At the top of the right panel, you'll find a set of controls:

- Toggle AI Agent: Shows or hides the AI Agent on the left panel

- Toggle Mini Panel: Expands or collapses a mini panel that displays your Projects, AI Agents, AI Teams, Automations and other workspace components.

- Dashboard: Brings you back to the main screen of the Home or selected App.

- Preview: Opens a live preview of your App (not available on the Home screen).

Taskade Assistant Agent (TAA)

The [Taskade Assistant Agent]($1) now lives in the left panel as you navigate across your workspace. This means you can interact with it without losing context.

Context Pills

At any point, the TAA's context is shown by a context pill located in the bottom-left corner of the chat — this lets you know what the Agent is currently aware of.

Here's how the AI Agent functions in different areas:

- Projects: The TAA works just as before. It can help you generate content, asnwer project-related questions, organize tasks, and assist with planning.

- Automations: The Agent can now view and edit your automations, and even help debug simple errors when asked.

- Preview Tab: In the App preview, the Agent can modify your app and connect automations and projects to it. All you need to do is ask it to do so.
