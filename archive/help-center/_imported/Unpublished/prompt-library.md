What Is Taskade Genesis?

Genesis is an AI app builder that creates complete business applications from a single prompt. You describe what you need, and Genesis builds a working app in minutes. Not a mockup or prototype, but fully functional software.

üí° Note: Want to start building apps? Visit our [Genesis Quick Start Guide]($1) first.

Who Is This Guide For?

This guide is for both new and experienced Taskade users. It provides examples, explanations, and prompt ideas to help you make the most of your Genesis experience. Here's everything you need to know to get started.

What Is a Prompt?

A prompt is simply what you tell Genesis to do.

Think of it like giving instructions to a personal assistant or chef:

- ‚ùå Vague instruction: ‚ÄúMake food.‚Äù ‚Üí You might get anything.
‚Äã

- ‚úÖ Clear instruction: ‚ÄúMake spaghetti with tomato sauce and garlic bread."

Genesis works the same way.

The clearer you are, the closer the result matches your vision.

The Anatomy of a Great Prompt

A well-structured Genesis prompt has three key elements:

- Context: Who will use the app and why.

- Core Function: What the app is supposed to do.

- Specific Details: What makes the solution unique to your business/idea.

‚Äã

Starter Apps

Start small and focus on one clear idea. Here are a few quick wins you should try.

üí° Pro Tip: Keep your first prompts focused on your core idea/problem. Clear, easy-to-understand instructions help Genesis build exactly what you need.

- Basic task manager sorted by lists

`"Build a simple to-do list app with categories."`

- Organize notes by topic with quick lookup

`"Create a notes app with folders and a search bar."`

- Track entries over time, visualize patterns

`"Make a daily mood tracker with a calendar view."`

- Store and organize personal recipes

`"Design a recipe book app with ingredients and steps."`

Adding Features

Once your starter app works, add features to make it more powerful.

üí° Pro Tip: Genesis will suggest context-aware changes and improvements to your app in the chat window. Click the prompt pills to request changes.

- Add basic authentication for multi-user access

`"Add a login page with email and password".`

- Add visual drag-and-drop workflow

`"Turn the to-do list into a kanban board."`

- Add time-based task alerts

`"Include reminders and notifications for tasks."`

Iterating &amp; Styling

Learn to adjust and refine apps for aesthetics, usability, and workflow.

üí° Pro Tip: Keep modifications specific. Avoid asking for multiple unrelated changes in one prompt. This makes it easier to iterate, test, and refine your app.

- Switch to a darker UI

`"Change the color theme to dark mode."`

- Improves app navigation

`"Add a sidebar with quick navigation."`

- Different UI for the same data

`"Replace the checklist view with a kanban board."`

- Removes extra features, keeps it lean

`"Simplify the interface to just tasks and deadlines."`

- Personalize the look and feel

`"Rebrand the app with my logo and colors."`

App Styling

Want your app to look cutting-edge? Here's how to request specific visual styles.

üí° Pro Tip: Visual styles are like clothing for apps. You can always switch to a different look without changing anything else.

- Apple-inspired simplicity

`"Make this look clean and minimal with lots of white space, simple icons, and only black and gray colors."`

- Modern, translucent look like iOS (glassmorphism)

`"Give the cards a frosted glass effect where you can slightly see through them with blurred backgrounds."`

- Gentle, touchable design (neumorphism)

`"Make buttons and cards look soft and pillowy, like they're pressed into or popping out of the background."`

- Attention-grabbing design

`"Use bright gradient backgrounds, bold colors that pop, and big typography that makes a statement."`

- Sophisticated tech look (dark mode)

`"Create a dark theme with neon accents, like a high-tech dashboard from a sci-fi movie."`

- Nostalgic, fun design (retro)

`"Give it a retro 80s vibe with pastel colors, rounded corners, and fun geometric shapes."`

Connecting Backend

Every Genesis app is a living, breathing part of your Taskade workspace. That means all your creations are powered by Taskade's core features:

- [AI Agents]($1) for executing tasks autonomously.
‚Äã

- [Projects]($1) for storing and organizing data.
‚Äã

- [Automations]($1) for connecting the dots between all the tools you already use.

You don't need to know the technical details to get your idea off the ground. Just tell Genesis what you need, and it will figure out what to build from the first prompt.

However, if you want more control, these prompts will help get started:

üí° Pro Tip: Visit [Integrations]($1) and explore all the tools you can connect.

- Daily digest email

`"Set up an automation that emails me every morning with today's tasks."`

- Auto-reminder bot

`"Create an agent that checks overdue tasks and pings Slack."`

- Backend data persistence

`"Link this app to a database project for storing customer info."`

- Auto-project generation
