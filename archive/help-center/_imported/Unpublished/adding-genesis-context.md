Overview

When you build apps with Genesis, you can upload reference files to provide context and guidance. The additional context will help Genesis understand your requirements, match your brand, and follow a specific design pattern.

ðŸ’¡ Note: Any files that you upload to the [TAA chat]($1) are added to the [Media tab]($1).

What You Can Use as Context

Genesis works with various file types to understand your requirements. Upload documents, images, data files, and code samples to amplify your builds.

Brand and Design Files

Upload your visual identity materials so Genesis can match your brand perfectly.

- Brand guidelines (PDF): Color codes, typography, logo usage, design principles
â€‹

- Logo files (PNG, JPG): Primary logos, variations, icons, and brand marks
â€‹

- Color palettes and style guides: Hex codes, color combinations, visual hierarchy
â€‹

- Website screenshots Current site design, layout patterns, UI elements
â€‹

- Mockups or wireframes: App layouts, user interface designs, navigation flows

Data and Structure Files

Share examples of data and processes to better explain your use case.

- Existing forms (PDF): Contact forms, registration forms, surveys, applications
â€‹

- Data examples: Table structures, field definitions, sample records
â€‹

- Workflow documents: Process flows, SOPs, business rules
â€‹

- Code snippets: Validation rules, integration examples, custom functions

Reference Materials

Show Genesis examples of what you like or want to replicate from other sources.

- Screenshots of apps: UI inspiration, feature examples, interaction patterns
â€‹

- Screenshots existing systems: Legacy applications, competitor tools
â€‹

- Process documentation: Standard procedures, user manuals, training materials
â€‹

- User requirements: Feature specifications, acceptance criteria, use cases
â€‹

- Technical documentation: API specs, integration guides, configuration files

Provide App Context

There are two different ways to provide context to Genesis depending on when you're in the app building process. Here's how to get started:

Initial Prompt

When you first prompt Genesis to build an app, you can provide text-based context. Paste relevant information directly into your initial prompt.

- Open Genesis and type your initial app prompt.
â€‹

- Paste text context like color codes, field lists, requirements, or code snippets.
â€‹

- Submit the prompt. Genesis will create the app using your text context.

Example:

`"Build a contact form with these fields: Name (required), Email (required), Phone (optional), Company, Message. Use these brand colors: Primary #1e3a8a, Secondary #f97316."`

Follow-Up Prompts

After Genesis creates your app, you can upload context files in follow-up prompts to refine and improve the app. Uploaded files will be added to the [Media tab]($1).

- Open your Genesis app in Preview mode after it's created.
â€‹

- Upload context files:
â€‹

- (method 1) Drag & drop files into the TAA chat window.
â€‹

- (method 2) Use the Attachment button (ðŸ“Ž)

- Ask Genesis to update the app using the new context.

Example:

`"Update this contact form to match our brand guidelines. Use the colors and fonts specified in the uploaded PDF. Apply our logo to the header."`
