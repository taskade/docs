Overview

AI prompts are the secret to building exactly what you envision. This guide will help you communicate with Genesis more effectively to create better apps faster.

ðŸ’¬ What is a prompt? A prompt is simply the description of what you want to build. Think of it as explaining your app idea to a smart colleague who can build it for you. The clearer your explanation, the better your app turns out.

1. Set Objectives

Explain who uses this and why it matters to your business.

- `"My restaurant staff needs to track inventory daily and get alerts when we're running low on key ingredients."â€‹`
- `"My real estate team needs to track property leads and automatically follow up with prospects who haven't responded in 48 hours."`
- `"Our consulting clients need a portal where they can access project deliverables, schedule meetings, and track billable hours."`

2.  Describe Outcomes

Be specific about functionality. Vague requests get vague results.

- `"Customers upload project files, see progress updates, message our team, and download final files. Everyone gets notifications for each step."`
- `"Employees submit expense reports with receipts, managers approve or reject them, accounting gets notified, and reimbursements are tracked until payment."`
- `"Students watch course videos, complete quizzes, track their progress, and receive certificates upon completion. Instructors can see engagement analytics."`

3. Explain the Journey

Walk Genesis through how people will actually use your app.

- `"New users sign up, answer a few questions about their needs, get matched with relevant resources, then receive weekly personalized updates."`
- `"Customers browse our service catalog, request quotes, upload requirements, review proposals, approve work, and rate their experience afterward."`
- `"Job applicants create profiles, upload resumes, apply for positions, take skills assessments, schedule interviews, and get status updates throughout the process."`

4. Break Down Ideas

For bigger projects, use simple numbered steps.

- `"1. Show real-time sales on a dashboard 2. Let users filter product type 3. Add export buttons for reports 4. Send alerts when sales drop"`
- `"1. Collect customer feedback through forms 2. Categorize responses by department 3. Route urgent issues to management 4. Generate monthly satisfaction reports 5. Send follow-up surveys automatically"`
- `"1. Display available appointment slots 2. Let clients book and pay online 3. Send confirmation emails and calendar invites 4. Allow rescheduling with 24-hour notice 5. Collect feedback after appointments"`

5. Connect Tools

Tell Genesis what you're already using so it can connect everything.

- `"Import customer data from Google Sheets and send automated email notifications via Gmail. Connect to Slack for team alerts and let customers update their information directly in the app."`
- `"Connect to WhatsApp Business for client communication. Integrate with our existing project database for customer records."`
- `"Pull inventory data from Google Sheets, connect to our accounting project for cost tracking, and send low-stock alerts to our Slack channel."`

6. Set the Tone

Your app should sound like your business. Tell Genesis how to communicate.

- `"Keep it professional but friendly, like talking to customers in person. Make error messages helpful, not technical."`
- `"Use an encouraging, supportive tone like a personal fitness coach. Celebrate user achievements and make setbacks feel manageable."`
- `"Sound like a trusted financial advisorâ€”authoritative but not intimidating. Use simple language to explain complex topics and always emphasize security."`

7. Choose Look & Feel

Tell Genesis how you want your app to look â€” colors, images, and overall vibe.

- `"Use a clean, modern design with our brand colors: navy blue headers and bright green accent buttons. Include our company logo in the top left. Make it feel professional but approachable, like our website."`
- `"Create a warm, welcoming design with soft colorsâ€”think spa-like with cream backgrounds and sage green accents. Use rounded corners and gentle shadows to feel calming and trustworthy."`
- `"Bold and energetic design with bright orange and black colors. Make it feel like a fitness app with strong typography and high-contrast buttons that motivate action."`

8. Define Access

Apps need different permissions. Be clear about who can do what.

- `"Staff can view all projects and add updates. Clients only see their own projects and can't edit. Managers access everything plus analytics."`
- `"Students can access their courses and submit assignments. Instructors can grade work and message students. Administrators can manage all users and see system-wide reports."`
- `"Regular employees can log hours and submit requests. Department heads can approve their team's requests. HR can access all employee data and generate company reports."`

9. Iterate Easily

Your app is not set in stone. Refine it and iterate with simple follow-up requests.

- `"The form works greatâ€”can you add file upload after the description and make the submit button bigger?"`
- `"Love the dashboard, but can you move the notifications to the top right and make the charts more colorful?"`
- `"The booking system is perfect, but can you add a text reminder 24 hours before appointments and let customers reschedule themselves?"`

10. Reference

Mention apps or websites with features you like.

- `"Make the dashboard layout similar to Stripe's interfaceâ€”clean cards with key metrics up top and detailed tables below. But simplify the navigation for less tech-savvy users."`
- `"Create a course layout like Udemyâ€”video player on the left, course outline on the right, with a clean progress bar. But make it feel more personal and less corporate."`
- `"Design the booking interface like Calendlyâ€”simple date/time selection with instant confirmation. But add our branding and include service descriptions for each appointment type."`

11. Provide Examples

Demonstrate workflows by describing specific scenarios.

- `"Customer inquiry: Contact form submitted â†’ Create lead record â†’ Send welcome email â†’ Notify sales team â†’ Set 3-day follow-up reminder"`
- `"New employee: HR creates profile â†’ Send welcome email with login â†’ Employee completes onboarding forms â†’ Manager gets notification â†’ Training modules assigned automatically"`
- `"Order process: Customer places order â†’ Inventory updated â†’ Payment processed â†’ Shipping label created â†’ Customer gets tracking info â†’ Follow-up review request sent after delivery"`

12. Experiment

Genesis saves your work automatically. Try bold changes and see what happens.

- `"Let's completely redesign the homepage layout" or "Remove the entire pricing section and replace it with a simple contact form."`
- `"What if we made this a single-page app instead of multiple screens?" or "Can we turn this form into a conversational chatbot experience?"`
- `"Let's try a completely different approachâ€”make this feel like a game with points and achievements instead of a boring business tool."`
