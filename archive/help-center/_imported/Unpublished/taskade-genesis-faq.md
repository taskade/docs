Sharing and Access

How do I test my app before sharing it?

Use the Preview feature to interact with your app exactly as users will. Test all functionality and make sure that all the parts are in place before publishing.

How do I publish my app?

Every app gets an individual URL immediately. Click "Open" to view your live app and copy the URL from your browser. You can share this link directly anywhere: email, social media, your website, or however you distribute to users.

Can I use my own domain name?

This feature is coming soon. You'll be able to use your own branded URL (like app.yourcompany.com) instead of the default Genesis link, giving your apps a more professional appearance that matches your brand.

Where does my app data live?

Your app and all its data live in Taskade's secure cloud infrastructure. This includes your app's projects, automation workflows, AI agents, and user data.

Who owns the apps I create?

You do. Your apps, data, and intellectual property belong to you completely. We provide the platform and infrastructure, but everything you build and all the content within your apps remains your property. You can modify or delete data at any time.

Data and Security

Can I control who uses my app?

Yes. Just tell Genesis what access you want and it sets it up for you. For example, "Make this app private with password protection" or "Only allow users with company email addresses." If you set a password, make sure to share it along with the app link.

How do users access my app?

Send them the link. No downloads or installations required. The apps you create with Genesis work in any web browser on desktop, tablet, or mobile phone.
