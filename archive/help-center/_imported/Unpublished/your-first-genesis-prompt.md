Overview

The difference between a great app and something that barely works often comes down to your first prompt. This guide will show you how to write that crucial first instruction to Genesis, the one that sets everything in motion.

üí° Note: You need ONE prompt to start. Everything else can be added later.

The First Prompt

Every successful first prompt answers three questions.

Audience

`"My photography clients..." "Our dental patients..." "My sales team..."`

Problem/Solution

`"...need to book sessions..." "...want to schedule appointments..." "...has to track leads..."`

Action

`"...and receive confirmations" "...with available time slots" "...and see follow-up dates"`

Formula

`"My photography clients need to book sessions and receive confirmations"`

That's a perfect first prompt. Clear, focused, actionable.

Use Prompt Enhancement

Not sure how to describe what you want? The Enhance Prompt feature takes your rough idea and turns it into a detailed, specific request that Genesis can act on.

Your First Prompt

- Go to the main Genesis dashboard.
‚Äã

- Type what you want (even if it's vague).
‚Äã

- Click "Enhance Prompt"
‚Äã

- Review the suggestions
‚Äã

- Hit generate with the improved prompt.

Follow-Up Prompts

- Wait for Genesis to generate your app.
‚Äã

- Type a follow-up prompt in the [TAA chat.]($1)
‚Äã

- Click "Enhance Prompt"
‚Äã

- Review the suggestions
‚Äã

- Hit generate with the improved prompt.

Starter Kits

Copy these templates and customize for your business.

Classic Contact Form

`"Build a contact form for [your business type] that emails me submissions"`

Booking Tool

`"Create a booking tool for [your service] with available time slots"`

Tracker for Anyhing

`"Make a tracker for [what you track] with status updates"`

Industry Calculator

`"Build a calculator for [your calculation] that shows totals"`

Pick one. Customize it. That's your first prompt.

Use the Right Words

Power Verbs

Start with these action words:

- Build a form that...
‚Äã

- Create a system for...
‚Äã

- Make a tool that...
‚Äã

- Design a dashboard showing...

Clarity Phrases

Add these for precision:

- Simple - keeps it focused
‚Äã

- Basic - avoids complexity
‚Äã

- For my [business type] - adds context
‚Äã

- That [does something] - defines the action

The 2-Sentence Rule

Ideally, your first prompt should not have more than two sentences.

One Sentence (Best)

`"Create a lead capture form for my real estate business with property preferences"`

Two Sentences (Extra Context)

`"I run a yoga studio with 5 instructors. Build a class booking system that shows available sessions"`

If you're writing a third sentence, save it for your second prompt.

Pick ONE Core Function

Your first prompt should do one thing excellently.

‚úÖ Focused First Prompts:

- `"Build a quote calculator for landscaping projects"`
- `"Create a waitlist for my restaurant"`
- `"Make a feedback form with star ratings"`

‚ùå Too Many Functions:

- `"Build a system that handles quotes, invoices, payments, exports, reminders, notifications, and customer management"`

üí° Note: You can add more features in 30 seconds after your calculator works.

Ideas/Solutions vs. Specs

Genesis handles all the technical details. You just describe what you need.

Natural Business Language

- `"Track which therapist is booked when"`
- `"Calculate project costs including labor"`
- `"Collect feedback after appointments"`

First Prompts That Work

Need inspiration? These actual first prompts created successful apps.

Service Business

- `"Build an appointment scheduler for my barbershop with service selection"`

Consulting

- `"Create a project status dashboard for my clients"`

Retail

- `"Make an inventory tracker that alerts when items are low"`

Healthcare

- `"Build a patient intake form with insurance information"`

Troubleshooting Prompts

Unexpected Functionality

Add context:

- `Before: "Build a booking system"`
- `After: "Build a booking system for my hair salon with 30-minute time slots"`

High Complexity

Use keywords like "simple" or "minimalist" and add complexity as you go:

- `Before: "Create a CRM"`
- `After: "Create a simple contact list with email and phone"`

Missing Features

Don't worry! You can add anything with your second prompt:

- `First: "Build a contact form"`
- `Second: "Add a file upload option"`

Genesis = Adventure

Professional developers spend weeks planning.

You can start building in one sentence and improve as you go. Your first prompt doesn't need to be perfect. It just needs to be clear about one thing you need.

Imagine It. Build it. Iterate.

Good luck!
