**What Is Project Sharing?**
----------------------------

There are many ways to collaborate on Taskade. The easiest way to get started is to create a project and share it with guests or other Taskade users.

**Invite Collaborators**
------------------------

You can invite an unlimited number of users to a Project via **email**, or simply by copying an invite link. Here's how it works:

1.   Open a Project and tap the **three dots****¬∑¬∑¬∑** in the top-right corner.

‚Äã

    *   You can also tap your **profile avatar** in the top-left corner of the project.

‚Äã

2.   Select üì§ **Share**and customize the invitation.

‚Äã

3.   Set [Permissions](https://intercom.help/taskade/en/articles/8958434) for the new team members (see the next section).

‚Äã

4.   Invite via **email**, **add workspace collaborators**, or **use contacts on your device**.

‚Äã

5.   Tap **Send Invite**to finish adding collaborators.
