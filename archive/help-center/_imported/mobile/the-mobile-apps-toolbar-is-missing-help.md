**Apple Users**
---------------

Apple users can add shortcuts from sources outside the Gallery, like from friends, websites, and more. These shared shortcuts are considered "untrusted" and to import them you must allow untrusted shortcuts in Settings. This includes the Taskade toolbar.

*   Allow untrusted shortcuts:

â€‹

    1.   Open the **Shortcuts** app and run any shortcut.

â€‹

    2.   Go to **Settings > Shortcuts**.

â€‹

    3.   Turn on **Allow Untrusted Shortcuts**. You wonâ€™t see this setting until you run a shortcut first.

**Android Users**
-----------------

Android users have a feature called Full Screen Gestures which can sometimes interfere with the Taskade toolbar from showing. Try disabling it and see if the toolbar appears.

*   Disable full-screen gestures:

â€‹

    1.   Go to **Settings**.

â€‹

    2.   Tap on **Display**.

â€‹

    3.   Scroll down and enter the **Navigation bar** section.

â€‹

    4.   Switch to **Navigation buttons**.

**I've tried it all but still can't get the toolbar to show!**
--------------------------------------------------------------
