Understand the difference between workspaces and teams in Taskade.

Updated over 5 months ago

**Overview**
------------

[Workspaces](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958483-create-a-workspace) and [Teams](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958495-create-a-team-folder) (formerly Folders) have separate members, templates, permissions, and [projects](https://intercom.help/taskade/en/articles/8958370). A single workspace can contain multiple teams, each acting as a self-contained space that lets you organize work.

**Workspace Home Space**
------------------------

Every workspace comes with a **Home space**. This is the default "container" for the space. If it's deleted, the entire workspace will be deleted.

**Roles & Permissions**
-----------------------

There are [five user roles](https://intercom.help/taskade/en/articles/8958484) you can choose from in a workspace/team. Users do not automatically inherit the workspace role when invited to teams. A user's role depends on the configured [Team Permissions](https://intercom.help/taskade/en/articles/8958493).

**Role****Access Level**
ü¶Ñ **Owner**Owners can fully configure and edit Projects, templates, and automations, manage Project/Workspace settings, and customize billing options.
üë©‚Äçüíª **Admin**Admins can fully configure and edit Projects/templates/automations and manage Projects/Workspace settings.
‚úçÔ∏è **Editor**Editors can edit projects/templates/automations in a workspace. They cannot manage project/workspace settings. They cannot create automations.
‚úÖ **Checker**Checkers can complete and comment on tasks. They cannot edit tasks, Projects, or templates.
ü§ì **Viewer**Viewers can only comment and chat in Projects. They cannot create or edit Projects or templates in a Workspace.

**Manage Clients/Teams**
------------------------

Clients and teams can be invited into Team spaces using the **Invite Only**permission without being invited to the Home space. This ensures that clients cannot see other teams nested under the same workspace.

Managing your teams through a single workspace is also more cost effective as all teams within an upgraded workspace have access to [Taskade's premium features](https://intercom.help/taskade/en/articles/8958628).
