**Overview**
------------

Are you a student looking for an effective tool to enhance your academic organization, collaboration, and productivity? This guide will walk you through various scenarios and steps to make the most out of Taskade in your academic life.

* * *

**Master the Hierarchy**
------------------------

Work in Taskade is organized into workspaces, folders, and projects. This three-tiered system lets you organize courses, notes, and assignments into separate compartments.

**🗂️ Workspace****📁 Folder****📄 Project**
Think of a workspace as a digital hub where you can centralize all your academic activities and materials. For example, you can have separate Workspaces for "Fall 2024 Semester," "Spring 2025 Semester," and so on.Folders within a workspace act as subcategories to help you further categorize your academic materials. For instance, within your "Fall 2024 Semester" workspace, you can create Folders like "Math," "Science," "English," and "History" to group related courses.Projects are where you can store and edit your academic work — notes, tasks, assignments, mind maps, attachments, and much more. A folder can hold many projects, each with course notes or major assignment.
