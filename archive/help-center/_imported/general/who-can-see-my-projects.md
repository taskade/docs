Understand the visibility settings for your projects.

Updated over a year ago

Projects in a private Workspace are hidden and invisible to others by default. You can [share the project](https://intercom.help/taskade/en/articles/8958373) or an entire**Workspace/Folder**to collaborate with your team. Any Projects inside a shared Workspace/Folder will be visible to everyone in that space.
