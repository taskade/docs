Now that you know what Taskade can do, let's start with a basic setup.

Set Up a Workspace for your Organization
----------------------------------------

Your educational institution's workspace will be the central hub where you manage all your classes, staff, and tasks. Here’s how to set it up:

### Step 1: Create a Shared Workspace

*   [Create a new workspace](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958483-create-a-workspace): 

    *   In your dashboard, click the **plus icon** on the left. 
    *   Enter the name of your workspace. 
    *   (optional) Choose a workspace logo. 
    *   [Invite team members to the workspace](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958486-invite-to-a-workspace). 

💡 **Note**: Sharing a workspace doesn't automatically grant members access to all folders inside it. You need to do this manually (see the next step).

### Step: 2 Add Folders

Folders help categorize different aspects of your operations.

*   [Create a new folder](https://help.taskade.com/en/articles/8958495-create-a-folder-subspace): 

    *   In a workspace, click ➕ **New folder** in the left navigation pane. 
    *   **Enter**the **name** for your folder and **choose a color palette**. 
    *   **Choose****a logo** from one of the available emojis or upload your own. 
    *   [Invite new members to the folder](https://s/8958494-share-a-folder). 

There are many ways to organize your organization using folders.

Check the hierarchies below for some ideas.

### Scenario 1: Student Groups Structure

Organize student groups based on grade levels to streamline access for teachers.

🗂️ **Folder Name**🔤 **Description**
Grade 10 Store class materials, assignments, and resources specific to Grade 10 students.
Grade 11 Organize lesson plans, assessments, and project guidelines for Grade 11 students.
Grade 12 Keep track of college readiness resources, senior projects, and graduation preparations for Grade 12 students.

### Scenario 2: Administrative Structure

This administrative structure helps maintain essential records and facilitate communication within the educational institution.

🗂️ **Folder Name**🔤 **Description**
Student Records Centralize records, grades, and attendance for all student groups.
Extracurricular Activities Organize information about student clubs, sports teams, and participation.
Communication and Feedback Manage newsletters, feedback forms, and communication with students and parents.
