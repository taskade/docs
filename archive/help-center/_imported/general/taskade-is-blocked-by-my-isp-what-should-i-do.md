Taskade is blocked by my ISP, what should I do?

Resolve issues with Taskade being blocked by your ISP.

Updated over a year ago

Sometimes, your internet service provider (ISP) may use security software that can mistakenly block access to the Taskade domain. This is unlikely to happen, but if you encounter problems, we recommend contacting your ISP directly to resolve the issue.

As an interim solution, you can use CloudFlare's free VPN 1.1.1.1 to access Taskade:

1.   Visit [https://1.1.1.1/](https://1.1.1.1/) in your web browser. 
2.   Choose your operating system and follow the instructions.

3.   Reopen Taskade and test the connection.
