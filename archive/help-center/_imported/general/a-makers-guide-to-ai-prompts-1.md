**Overview**
============

AI prompts are the secret to building exactly what you envision. This guide will help you communicate with Genesis more effectively to create better apps faster.

**💬 What is a prompt?**A prompt is simply the description of what you want to build. Think of it as explaining your app idea to a smart colleague who can build it for you. The clearer your explanation, the better your app turns out.

* * *

**1. Set Objectives**
---------------------

Explain who uses this and why it matters to your business.

*   "My restaurant staff needs to track inventory daily and get alerts when we're running low on key ingredients."​ 
*   "My real estate team needs to track property leads and automatically follow up with prospects who haven't responded in 48 hours." 
*   "Our consulting clients need a portal where they can access project deliverables, schedule meetings, and track billable hours." 

* * *

**2. Describe Outcomes**
------------------------

Be specific about functionality. Vague requests get vague results.

*   "Customers upload project files, see progress updates, message our team, and download final files. Everyone gets notifications for each step." 
*   "Employees submit expense reports with receipts, managers approve or reject them, accounting gets notified, and reimbursements are tracked until payment." 
*   "Students watch course videos, complete quizzes, track their progress, and receive certificates upon completion. Instructors can see engagement analytics." 

* * *

**3. Explain the Journey**
--------------------------

Walk Genesis through how people will actually use your app.

*   "New users sign up, answer a few questions about their needs, get matched with relevant resources, then receive weekly personalized updates." 
*   "Customers browse our service catalog, request quotes, upload requirements, review proposals, approve work, and rate their experience afterward." 
*   "Job applicants create profiles, upload resumes, apply for positions, take skills assessments, schedule interviews, and get status updates throughout the process." 

* * *

**4. Break Down Ideas**
-----------------------

For bigger projects, use simple numbered steps.

*   "1. Show real-time sales on a dashboard 2. Let users filter product type 3. Add export buttons for reports 4. Send alerts when sales drop" 
*   "1. Collect customer feedback through forms 2. Categorize responses by department 3. Route urgent issues to management 4. Generate monthly satisfaction reports 5. Send follow-up surveys automatically" 
*   "1. Display available appointment slots 2. Let clients book and pay online 3. Send confirmation emails and calendar invites 4. Allow rescheduling with 24-hour notice 5. Collect feedback after appointments" 

* * *

**5. Connect Tools**
--------------------

Tell Genesis what you're already using so it can connect everything.

*   "Import customer data from Google Sheets and send automated email notifications via Gmail. Connect to Slack for team alerts and let customers update their information directly in the app." 
*   "Connect to WhatsApp Business for client communication. Integrate with our existing project database for customer records." 
*   "Pull inventory data from Google Sheets, connect to our accounting project for cost tracking, and send low-stock alerts to our Slack channel." 

* * *

**6. Set the Tone**
-------------------

Your app should sound like your business. Tell Genesis how to communicate.

*   "Keep it professional but friendly, like talking to customers in person. Make error messages helpful, not technical." 
*   "Use an encouraging, supportive tone like a personal fitness coach. Celebrate user achievements and make setbacks feel manageable." 
*   "Sound like a trusted financial advisor—authoritative but not intimidating. Use simple language to explain complex topics and always emphasize security." 

* * *

**7. Choose Look & Feel**
-------------------------

Tell Genesis how you want your app to look — colors, images, and overall vibe.

*   "Use a clean, modern design with our brand colors: navy blue headers and bright green accent buttons. Include our company logo in the top left. Make it feel professional but approachable, like our website." 
*   "Create a warm, welcoming design with soft colors—think spa-like with cream backgrounds and sage green accents. Use rounded corners and gentle shadows to feel calming and trustworthy." 
*   "Bold and energetic design with bright orange and black colors. Make it feel like a fitness app with strong typography and high-contrast buttons that motivate action." 

* * *

**8. Define Access**
--------------------

Apps need different permissions. Be clear about who can do what.

*   "Staff can view all projects and add updates. Clients only see their own projects and can't edit. Managers access everything plus analytics." 
*   "Students can access their courses and submit assignments. Instructors can grade work and message students. Administrators can manage all users and see system-wide reports." 
*   "Regular employees can log hours and submit requests. Department heads can approve their team's requests. HR can access all employee data and generate company reports." 

* * *

**9. Iterate Easily**
---------------------

Your app is not set in stone. Refine it and iterate with simple follow-up requests.

*   "The form works great—can you add file upload after the description and make the submit button bigger?" 
*   "Love the dashboard, but can you move the notifications to the top right and make the charts more colorful?" 
*   "The booking system is perfect, but can you add a text reminder 24 hours before appointments and let customers reschedule themselves?" 

* * *

**10. Reference**
-----------------

Mention apps or websites with features you like.

*   "Make the dashboard layout similar to Stripe's interface—clean cards with key metrics up top and detailed tables below. But simplify the navigation for less tech-savvy users." 
*   "Create a course layout like Udemy—video player on the left, course outline on the right, with a clean progress bar. But make it feel more personal and less corporate." 
*   "Design the booking interface like Calendly—simple date/time selection with instant confirmation. But add our branding and include service descriptions for each appointment type." 

* * *

**11. Provide Examples**
------------------------

Demonstrate workflows by describing specific scenarios.

*   "Customer inquiry: Contact form submitted → Create lead record → Send welcome email → Notify sales team → Set 3-day follow-up reminder" 
*   "New employee: HR creates profile → Send welcome email with login → Employee completes onboarding forms → Manager gets notification → Training modules assigned automatically" 
*   "Order process: Customer places order → Inventory updated → Payment processed → Shipping label created → Customer gets tracking info → Follow-up review request sent after delivery" 

* * *

**12. Experiment**
------------------

Genesis saves your work automatically. Try bold changes and see what happens.

*   "Let's completely redesign the homepage layout" or "Remove the entire pricing section and replace it with a simple contact form." 
*   "What if we made this a single-page app instead of multiple screens?" or "Can we turn this form into a conversational chatbot experience?" 
*   "Let's try a completely different approach—make this feel like a game with points and achievements instead of a boring business tool."
