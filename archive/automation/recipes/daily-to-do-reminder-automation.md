## How It Works

### Automation Flow

The system operates through an intelligent daily cycle:

```
Daily Trigger → Task Scanning → Filtering → Formatting → Delivery → Tracking
```

**Daily Process:**
1. **Scheduled Trigger**: Automation runs at your specified time each day
2. **Project Scanning**: Searches designated projects for incomplete tasks
3. **Smart Filtering**: Applies custom filters (priority, due dates, assignees, etc.)
4. **Content Formatting**: Transforms task data into readable reminder format
5. **Channel Delivery**: Sends reminders via your preferred communication method
6. **Progress Logging**: Records reminder delivery for analytics and optimization

### Core Components

**Trigger System:**
- **Schedule-Based**: Runs at consistent times (morning, evening, or custom)
- **Timezone Aware**: Respects your local time zone for optimal delivery

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Basic Daily Reminder Setup

**Create an automation to send reminders about uncompleted tasks:**

1. **Create Automation**: Navigate to your workspace and click "Automations" → "Create New"
2. **Set Daily Trigger**:
   - Choose "Every Day" trigger
   - Set preferred "Time Of Day" (e.g., 9:00 AM)
   - Configure your "Time Zone"
3. **Add Find Tasks Action**:
   - Select your main task project
   - Set "Tasks to Return" to "Return all matching tasks as array"
   - Add filter: "Task Completed At" → "Is Empty" (finds uncompleted tasks)
4. **Add Transform Array Action**:
   - Reference the task array from previous step
   - Format display template (e.g., "• {task_name} - Due: {due_date}")
   - Preview the formatted output
5. **Add Delivery Action**:
   - Choose "Slack Send Channel Message" or "Send Email"
   - Reference the formatted task list with @ symbol
   - Configure message formatting and recipient

### Priority-Based Filtering

**Enhance reminders to focus on high-priority tasks:**

1. **Modify Find Tasks Action**: Add additional filter conditions
2. **Add Priority Filter**:
   - Click "And" to add another condition
   - Select custom field for priority tracking
   - Choose "Exactly matches" condition
   - Set value to desired priority level (High, Urgent, etc.)
3. **Multiple Priority Levels**:
   - Create separate automations for different priority levels
   - Set different delivery times (urgent = immediate, high = morning)
   - Use different channels (urgent = Slack, high = email)

### Advanced Configuration Options
