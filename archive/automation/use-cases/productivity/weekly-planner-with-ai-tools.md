3. **Automated Assignment**: Tasks routed to appropriate team members or departments
4. **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of task status and completion
5. **Status Reporting**: Automated generation of weekly progress reports
6. **Email Notifications**: Scheduled delivery of status updates and reminders
7. **Performance Analysis**: Weekly productivity metrics and insights

### Core System Components
