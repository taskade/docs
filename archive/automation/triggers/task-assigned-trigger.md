**Assignment Events:**
```javascript
// Trigger activates when:
- New task assigned to team member
- Task reassigned from one person to another
- Task assigned during creation
- Bulk task assignments
- Task assignment via API or integrations

// Does NOT trigger when:
- Task completed (use Task Completed trigger)
- Task status changed (use Status Changed trigger)
- Due dates modified (use Due Date Changed trigger)
- Comments added (use New Comment trigger)
```

**Incorrect Context Data:**
- âœ… Ensure task and assignee information is complete
- âœ… Check custom field permissions and access
- âœ… Verify integration connections are active
- âœ… Review automation action configurations

**Performance Problems:**
- âœ… Monitor automation execution times
- âœ… Check for rate limiting on external integrations
- âœ… Optimize complex workflow logic
- âœ… Review and clean up unused triggers

### Advanced Diagnostics

**Trigger Logs:**
```javascript
// Access detailed assignment logs
1. Go to Project Settings â†’ Automations

> **ðŸ’¡ ProTip**: The Task Assigned trigger transforms task delegation from a simple checkbox into a comprehensive coordination event. Use it to ensure that every assignment comes with the necessary preparation, communication, and follow-up actions automatically. The key is designing workflows that reduce handoff friction while maintaining accountability and team coordination.

Task Assigned triggers ensure that responsibility delegation becomes an opportunity for team alignment, not just task distribution. They create seamless handoffs that keep projects moving forward with clear ownership and expectations. ðŸŽ¯ðŸ‘¥
