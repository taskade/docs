## Trigger Behavior and Context

### What Triggers the Automation

**Due Date Events:**
```javascript
// Trigger activates when:
- New task created with due date
- Due date added to existing task
- Due date modified on existing task (optional)
- Due date removed (configurable)

// Does NOT trigger when:
- Task completed without due date
- Due date is in the past (configurable)
- Task is archived or deleted
```

**Context Variables Available:**
```javascript
// Rich context passed to automations
trigger: {
  event: "due_date_added",
  timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  task: {
    id: "task_12345",
    name: "Complete project proposal",
    assignee_id: "user_67890",
    project_id: "project_111",
    due_date: "2024-02-15T17:00:00Z",
    priority: "high",
    tags: ["urgent", "client"],
    custom_fields: {
      estimated_hours: 8,

- Monitor trigger execution and optimize slow workflows
- Archive old triggers that are no longer needed

### Workflow Design

**Context Utilization:**
- Leverage rich task and project context in automations
- Use conditional logic for different deadline types
- Include error handling for edge cases
- Design for scalability as team/project size grows

**User Experience:**
- Provide clear, actionable notifications
- Include context about why the deadline matters
- Offer escalation paths for urgent deadlines
- Balance automation with human oversight needs

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Trigger Performance

**Execution Metrics:**
```javascript
// Track trigger effectiveness
analytics: {
  executions: {
    total: 1250,
    successful: 1225,
    failed: 25,
    average_response_time: "1.8 seconds"
  },
  coverage: {
    tasks_with_due_dates: 85,

  impact: {
    on_time_completion_rate: "94%",
    stakeholder_satisfaction: "4.6/5",
    reduced_missed_deadlines: "67%"
  }
}
```

### Deadline Intelligence

  common_deadline_types: {
    "end_of_week": 35,
    "end_of_month": 28,
    "project_milestones": 22,
    "client_deadlines": 15
  },

    "early_notification": "89% on-time completion",
    "clear_ownership": "92% success rate",
    "realistic_timelines": "87% achievement rate"
  },
  improvement_opportunities: {
    "frequent_changes": "23 tasks with >3 deadline changes",
    "bottleneck_projects": "5 projects with chronic delays",
    "resource_conflicts": "12 overlapping high-priority deadlines"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Trigger Not Firing:**
- ✅ Verify trigger is enabled and properly configured
- ✅ Check that due date is in the future (past dates may be ignored)
- ✅ Ensure task meets any filter conditions
- ✅ Confirm automation permissions are correct

**Delayed Execution:**
- ✅ Check for configured delays in trigger settings
- ✅ Verify system load and queue status
- ✅ Review network connectivity and API status
- ✅ Monitor for rate limiting issues

**Incorrect Context:**
- ✅ Validate task and project data availability
- ✅ Check custom field permissions and access
- ✅ Review automation action configurations
- ✅ Test with different task types and assignees

### Advanced Diagnostics

**Trigger Logs:**
```javascript
// Access detailed execution logs
1. Go to Project Settings → Automations
2. Click on "Trigger History" tab
3. Filter by trigger type and time range
4. Review execution details and errors
5. Export logs for analysis if needed
```

**Performance Monitoring:**
- Track execution times and success rates
- Monitor for failed or stuck automations
- Identify bottlenecks in complex workflows
- Review resource usage and optimization opportunities

> **💡 ProTip**: The New Due Date trigger transforms deadline setting from a simple calendar entry into a comprehensive project management event. Use it to ensure that every deadline comes with the necessary planning, communication, and follow-up actions automatically. The key is designing workflows that add value without creating notification overload.

New Due Date triggers ensure that deadline management becomes proactive rather than reactive, keeping your projects on track and your team informed about important dates and deliverables.
