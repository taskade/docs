```javascript
// Optimize agent prompts for better triggering
effective_prompt: `
You are a customer support agent. When users report issues:

1. Acknowledge their problem empathetically
2. Ask clarifying questions if needed
3. Extract key information (name, issue, urgency)
4. Trigger appropriate automation workflows
5. Confirm actions taken and next steps

Available triggers:
- create_support_ticket: For technical issues
- escalate_to_manager: For urgent or complex problems
- schedule_callback: For follow-up required
- provide_resources: For self-service solutions

Always prioritize customer satisfaction and clear communication.
`
```

**Trigger Calibration:**
- Start with clear, specific trigger conditions
- Test with various conversation scenarios
- Monitor false positives and negatives
- Refine based on real usage patterns
- Balance automation with human oversight

**Error Handling:**
```javascript
// Robust error handling for agent triggers
error_handling: {
  validation_errors: {
    missing_parameters: "Ask user for missing information",
    invalid_data: "Request corrected information",
    permission_denied: "Escalate to human agent"
  },
  execution_failures: {
    api_errors: "Retry with exponential backoff",
    timeout_errors: "Switch to manual processing",
    service_unavailable: "Notify user of delay"
  },
  fallback_procedures: {
    automation_failure: "Create manual task for human processing",
    agent_confusion: "Transfer to human support",
    complex_scenarios: "Escalate to specialized team"
  }
}
```
