## Trigger Behavior and Timing

### Execution Timing

**Precise Scheduling:**
```javascript
// Schedule configuration examples
hourly_schedule: {
  interval: "every_2_hours",
  start_time: "09:00",
  timezone: "America/New_York",
  active_days: ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday"]
}

daily_schedule: {
  time: "06:00",
  timezone: "UTC",
  skip_weekends: false,
  business_days_only: true
}

weekly_schedule: {
  days: ["monday", "wednesday", "friday"],
  time: "09:00",
  timezone: "Europe/London",
  week_start: "monday"
}

monthly_schedule: {
  day: 1, // 1st of month
  time: "08:00",
  timezone: "Asia/Tokyo",
  last_day_of_month: false
}
```

**Smart Execution:**
- **Business Hours**: Respect company working hours
- **Holiday Awareness**: Skip execution on holidays
- **Time Zone Intelligence**: Execute at appropriate local times
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute execution across time periods
- **Failure Recovery**: Automatic retry on execution failures

### Context and Environment

**Execution Context:**
```javascript
// Information available during scheduled execution
execution_context: {
  trigger_type: "schedule",
  scheduled_time: "2024-01-15T09:00:00Z",
  actual_execution_time: "2024-01-15T09:00:02Z",
  timezone: "America/New_York",
  frequency: "daily",
  execution_count: 247,
  last_execution_status: "success",
  next_execution_time: "2024-01-16T09:00:00Z"
}
```

**Environment Awareness:**
- **System Load**: Adjust execution based on system performance
- **Data Availability**: Wait for dependent data to be ready
- **Resource Constraints**: Scale execution based on available resources
- **Maintenance Windows**: Schedule around system maintenance periods
