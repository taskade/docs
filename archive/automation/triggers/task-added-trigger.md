## Trigger Behavior and Context

### What Triggers the Automation

**Task Creation Events:**
```javascript
// Trigger activates when:
- New task created via UI, API, or integrations
- Task added through templates or duplication
- Task created via email forwarding or external sources
- Bulk task creation operations
- Task creation meets specified filter criteria

// Does NOT trigger when:
- Existing tasks are edited or updated
- Task status or assignee changes
- Comments added to existing tasks
- Tasks are moved between projects
- Archived tasks are restored
```

**Context Variables Available:**

**Incorrect Context:**
- âœ… Verify task data is fully populated before triggering
- âœ… Check user permissions for data access
- âœ… Review automation timing and delays
- âœ… Test with various task types and content

**Performance Issues:**
- âœ… Monitor automation execution times
- âœ… Check for complex analysis on large tasks
- âœ… Review content processing efficiency
- âœ… Optimize template application logic

### Advanced Diagnostics

**Task Analysis:**
```javascript
// Debug task creation processing
1. Access Project Settings â†’ Automations
2. Select "Trigger History" tab
3. Filter by Task Added trigger
4. Review task creation context and processing
5. Check automation execution logs
6. Analyze performance metrics
```

**Optimization Analysis:**
- Track task creation patterns by user and team
- Monitor automation success rates and failure points
