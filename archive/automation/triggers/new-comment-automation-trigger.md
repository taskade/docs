## Best Practices

### Comment Monitoring Strategy

Set up effective comment triggers that enhance rather than disrupt collaboration.

**Scope Management:**
- **Targeted Monitoring**: Focus on high-collaboration projects and critical feedback channels
- **Keyword Filtering**: Use specific keywords to trigger only relevant automation
- **Comment Types**: Differentiate between regular comments, mentions, and system notifications
- **Project Segmentation**: Monitor different project types with appropriate response workflows

**Notification Balance:**
- **Avoid Spam**: Use intelligent filtering to prevent notification overload
- **Context Awareness**: Include relevant project context in notifications
- **Frequency Control**: Implement cooldown periods for busy projects
- **Personalization**: Tailor notifications based on user preferences and roles

### Workflow Integration

Design comment automation that complements existing communication processes.

**Process Integration:**
- **Existing Workflows**: Ensure triggers enhance rather than conflict with current processes
- **Approval Chains**: Integrate with existing review and approval processes
- **Escalation Procedures**: Connect with established escalation protocols
- **Documentation Standards**: Maintain consistent record-keeping practices

**Team Communication:**
- **Clear Expectations**: Communicate automation rules to team members
- **Training**: Educate teams on how to write effective trigger comments
- **Feedback Loops**: Allow teams to provide feedback on automation effectiveness
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly review and optimize comment workflows

## Troubleshooting

### Common Comment Trigger Issues

Resolve frequent problems with comment automation configurations.

**Trigger Not Firing:**
- **Scope Settings**: Verify trigger is monitoring intended projects/blocks
- **Comment Types**: Check if trigger filters match the comment type
- **Keyword Matching**: Ensure keyword filters are correctly configured
