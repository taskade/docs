{% endhint %}

## Overview

The Notion integration connects Taskade's project management capabilities with Notion's powerful knowledge management system. By embedding Taskade projects directly within Notion pages, you create a seamless workflow where documentation and execution happen in the same space.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Full Project Embedding**: Embed complete Taskade projects in Notion pages
- **Live Synchronization**: Changes in embedded projects reflect immediately
- **Interactive Functionality**: Full Taskade functionality within Notion interface
- **Flexible Permissions**: Viewer or editor access control
- **Bidirectional Workflow**: Documentation in Notion, execution in Taskade

## Setting Up the Integration

### Prerequisites
**Requirements:**
- Active Taskade account
- Active Notion account
- Project to embed (can be created specifically for Notion integration)

### Basic Embedding Process

#### Step 1: Create or Select a Taskade Project
**Project Preparation:**
1. Create a new project in Taskade or select an existing one
2. Organize your project structure (tasks, subtasks, sections)
3. Set up any custom fields or views you want to display in Notion

**Best Practices:**
- Create projects specifically for Notion embedding
- Use clear, descriptive project names
- Organize content in a way that makes sense when viewed in Notion context

#### Step 2: Generate Sharing Link
**Link Creation:**
1. Open the Taskade project you want to embed
2. Click the **Share** button in the top-right corner
3. Select **Invite to project** from the dropdown menu
4. Choose permission level:
   - **ü§ì Viewer**: Read-only access for viewing and checking tasks
   - **‚úçÔ∏è Editor**: Full editing capabilities within the embedded view

#### Step 3: Embed in Notion Page
**Embedding Process:**
1. Navigate to your Notion workspace
2. Open the page where you want to embed the project
3. Type **/embed** or paste the Taskade sharing link directly
4. The embedded project will load and display within your Notion page

## Permission Levels and Access Control

### Viewer Access (ü§ì)
**Capabilities:**
- View project structure and content
- Check off completed tasks
- Add comments to tasks
- View project progress and status
- Access all project views (List, Board, Calendar, etc.)

**Limitations:**
- Cannot create new tasks
- Cannot edit existing task content
- Cannot modify project structure
- Cannot delete tasks or sections

### Editor Access (‚úçÔ∏è)
**Capabilities:**

- Create new tasks and subtasks
- Edit existing task content and descriptions
- Modify project structure (add/remove sections)
- Assign tasks to team members
- Set due dates and priorities
- Add attachments and links
- Use all Taskade features within the embedded view

**Best Practices:**
- Use Editor access for collaborative projects
- Reserve Viewer access for stakeholder reviews
- Regularly review and update permissions as needed

## Advanced Integration Patterns

### Documentation + Execution Workflow
**Workflow Structure:**
1. **Notion Page**: Project documentation, requirements, and specifications
2. **Embedded Taskade Project**: Executable tasks, progress tracking, and team collaboration
3. **Integrated Updates**: Changes in either platform reflect in real-time

**Example Use Cases:**
- **Product Development**: Requirements in Notion, development tasks in Taskade
- **Content Creation**: Editorial guidelines in Notion, content tasks in Taskade
- **Event Planning**: Event details in Notion, logistics tasks in Taskade
- **Research Projects**: Research notes in Notion, action items in Taskade

### Knowledge Base Integration
**Knowledge Management:**
- Embed project status updates in team knowledge bases
- Create living documentation that updates automatically
- Share project progress with stakeholders
- Maintain project history and documentation in one place

### Team Collaboration Hub
**Centralized Workspaces:**
- Embed multiple projects on a single Notion dashboard
- Create project portfolios and status overviews
- Share work-in-progress with leadership teams
- Maintain transparency across different initiatives

## Managing Embedded Projects

### Link Regeneration and Security
**Access Control:**
- Regenerate sharing links to revoke access
- Change permission levels as needed
- Monitor who has access to embedded projects
- Regular security audits of shared links

**Regeneration Process:**
1. Open the project in Taskade
2. Click **Share** ‚Üí **Invite to project**
3. Click **Regenerate Link** in the invite link tab
4. Distribute the new link to authorized users

**Security Note:** Regenerated links cannot be restored, so inform all users before regenerating.

### Performance Optimization
**Best Practices:**
- Embed only necessary projects on high-traffic pages
- Use appropriate view settings for embedded projects
- Regularly clean up unused embedded projects
- Monitor page load times and optimize as needed

### Content Synchronization
**Real-time Updates:**
- Changes made in Taskade reflect immediately in Notion
- Comments and updates sync across both platforms
- Task status changes update in real-time
- Team member assignments sync automatically

## Integration with Notion Features

- Combine text, images, and embedded projects seamlessly

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Embedding Problems
**Common Issues:**
- **Link Not Working**: Ensure you're using the invite link, not the embed code
- **Permission Errors**: Check that sharing permissions are set correctly
- **Loading Issues**: Verify internet connection and try refreshing the page
- **Display Problems**: Check browser compatibility and clear cache

### Synchronization Issues
