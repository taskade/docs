- `Impact Score` (1-10 rating)
- `Implementation Effort` (Small, Medium, Large)
- `Status` (New, Under Review, Approved, In Development, Testing, Done, Rejected)

### 2. Design Customer-Facing Forms

Create user-friendly forms that capture comprehensive feedback while maintaining a positive customer experience.

**Essential Form Fields:**
