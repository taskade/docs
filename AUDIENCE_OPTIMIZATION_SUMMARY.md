# Audience Optimization: Reddit vs Hacker News

## 🎯 **Target Audience Strategy**

**docs.taskade.com/** → **Reddit Power Users**  
**docs.taskade.com/developers** → **Hacker News Audience**

## 📚 **Main Documentation: Reddit Power User Approach**

### **Tone & Language**
- ✅ **Conversational & Authentic**: "Think Notion meets ChatGPT meets Zapier, but actually usable"
- ✅ **No BS Attitude**: "Most productivity apps are built by people who've never actually used them daily"  
- ✅ **Relatable Problems**: "Tired of juggling 10 different apps just to get things done?"
- ✅ **Real Talk**: Direct, honest communication without corporate speak

### **Content Focus**
- ✅ **Real Use Cases**: "Side Projects That Don't Die", "Remote Team Coordination"
- ✅ **Community Quotes**: Actual user testimonials with specific problems solved
- ✅ **Practical Benefits**: Focus on what you can actually accomplish, not features
- ✅ **Relatable Scenarios**: Examples Reddit users would recognize and connect with

### **Examples**
**BEFORE (Corporate):** "Coordinate complex projects with automated status updates"  
**AFTER (Reddit):** *"No more 'can you see my screen?' or 'let me send you that link again.'"*

**BEFORE (Generic):** "Build powerful task management and data collection systems"  
**AFTER (Authentic):** *"Finally, a way to track my 47 ongoing projects without losing my mind."*
