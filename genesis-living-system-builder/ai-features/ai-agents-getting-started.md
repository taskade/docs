# AI Agents Getting Started

Transform your workspace with smart AI assistants that understand your business and can handle tasks automatically!

## What are AI Agents?

AI Agents are specialized assistants designed to automate activities like research, data analysis, and content creation. Think of them as smart team members who:

* 🧠 **Learn your business** by reading your documents and projects
* 🤖 **Answer questions** about your work and processes
* ⚡ **Take actions** like creating tasks, sending emails, or updating spreadsheets
* 🔄 **Work 24/7** without breaks, weekends, or vacations

**Real example:** Your "Customer Service Agent" can instantly answer questions about your products, create support tickets, and even draft response emails - all based on your existing knowledge base.
