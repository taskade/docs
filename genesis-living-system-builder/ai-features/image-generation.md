## Image Generation Best Practices

| Practice | Why | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Specify aspect ratio** | Prevents cropping issues | "1:1 (square)" or "16:9 (landscape)" |
| **State "No text"** | AI-generated text often has errors | Always include "No text, no logos" |
| **Request "No transparency"** | Ensures usable backgrounds | "Solid [color] background" |
| **Use "consistent" for sets** | Keeps visual coherence across images | "Keep identical framing, lighting, and style" |
| **Describe lighting** | Controls mood and professionalism | "Studio lighting" or "Soft, natural lighting" |
| **Reference your brand** | Maintains consistency with your app | "Use our brand colors: navy #1a365d" |
| **Be specific about subject** | Reduces generation attempts | "Stainless-steel water bottle" not "a product" |
