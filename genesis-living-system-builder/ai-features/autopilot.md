## Overview

Taskade Autopilot is a **workspace generation system** that transforms a single prompt into an entire interconnected ecosystem of projects, agents, and automations. Unlike traditional project management that requires manual setup, Autopilot constructs complete operational workspaces instantly.

> **Genesis connection:** Autopilot creates workspace ecosystems (projects + agents + automations). Genesis goes further — building full **deployable web applications** with UI, databases, and hosting. Together, they're the fastest way to build your complete Workspace DNA.

## What Autopilot Creates

From a single prompt, Autopilot generates:

| Component | What's Created | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Projects** | Multiple connected projects with task structures and timelines | Sprint board, backlog, docs, meeting notes |
| **AI Agents** | Specialized agents trained for workspace roles | Project Manager agent, QA agent, Copywriter agent |
| **Agent Teams** | Groups of agents that collaborate | Marketing team, Engineering team |
| **Automations** | Workflow flows connecting projects, agents, and tools | Daily standup → Slack, task completion → report |

## When to Use Autopilot

| Scenario | Why Autopilot Helps |
|---|---|
| **New team setup** | Need complete operational structure with projects, agents, and workflows from day one |
| **Scattered workflows** | Current tools are disconnected — need a unified, interconnected workspace |
| **Urgent projects** | Need a full workspace running immediately for a new initiative |
| **Manual process replacement** | Want to replace repetitive processes with AI-driven automation |
| **Department onboarding** | Need a structured workspace for a new department or function |
