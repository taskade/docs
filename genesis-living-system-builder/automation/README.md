# Automations: Living Motion

**Act. Execute. Evolve.** Taskade Automations are the living motion layer of Workspace DNA, transforming static workflows into intelligent, adaptive systems that act with precision and learn from every execution.

**Living Motion Layer** — Automations that don't just execute tasks, but learn from patterns, adapt to changing conditions, and continuously improve business outcomes.

## What is Living Motion?

Living Motion is Taskade’s automation layer. It’s how your workspace can **react**, **decide**, and **execute** when something happens.

Canonical foundation: [Workspace DNA](/broken/spaces/EOkDZjClZ0y8qSYnc7hO/pages/P4wpImYZWqgmWWCnK5z6).

### What you use it for

* **Notifications**: send Slack/Teams/email alerts.
* **Routing**: assign work based on content, priority, or owner.
* **Sync**: keep CRMs, Sheets, and databases updated.
* **Reporting**: scheduled summaries and digests.
* **Approvals**: add a human-in-the-loop before publishing or sending.

### Core building blocks

#### Triggers

Triggers start workflows. Common ones are schedules, forms, webhooks, and project events.

#### Actions

Actions do work. Create tasks, update fields, call webhooks, send notifications, and more.

#### Conditions and branching

Use branches to route different cases. Example: urgent → page someone, normal → add to queue.

#### AI steps

Use an agent to classify, extract, or draft. Then route or act on the structured result.

### Getting started (fast)

1. Pick one workflow you want end-to-end.
2. Choose one trigger.
3. Add 1–3 actions.
4. Test with real data.
5. Add branching and AI only if needed.

### Typical workflows

* Form submission → classify → create task → notify channel
* Webhook → normalize data → update CRM → log result
* Schedule → build weekly summary → send digest
