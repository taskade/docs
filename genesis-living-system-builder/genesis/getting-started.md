## Before You Start

### What You Need

### What You Can Build

By the end of this guide, you'll have built and published a fully functional app. It can be a client portal, tracker, or dashboard. The only limitation is your imagination. Genesis handles the technical complexity, you focus on business value.

### What You'll Learn

***

## Step 1: Identify Your Business Problem (1 minute)

Start by thinking about something in your business that could work better. Common problems Genesis solves:

### **Customer Frustrations**

* _"Customers keep calling to book appointments when we're busy"_
* _"People submit support requests through random channels"_
* _"Clients don't know the status of their projects"_

### **Team Inefficiencies**

* _"We lose track of inventory and run out of popular items"_
* _"Following up with leads happens inconsistently"_
* _"Important tasks fall through the cracks"_

### **Data Chaos**

* _"Customer feedback is scattered across emails and reviews"_
* _"I can't see which products are performing well"_
* _"Team performance data is hard to track"_

**Your turn:** Write down the ONE business problem you want to solve first.

## Step 2: Craft Your App Description (2 minutes)

Now turn your problem into a clear description using this proven formula:

### **The Magic Formula**

**WHO** uses it + **WHAT** they need to do + **WHAT** happens automatically

### **Template to Copy**

```
I run a [YOUR BUSINESS TYPE] and need [WHO WILL USE THIS] to [WHAT THEY NEED TO DO].

They should be able to [SPECIFIC ACTIONS THEY TAKE], and when they do, the system should [AUTOMATIC RESPONSES/ACTIONS].

I want to [HOW YOU'LL USE THE DATA] so I can [BUSINESS OUTCOME YOU WANT].
```

### **Real Examples**

**Restaurant Owner:**

```
I run a restaurant and need customers to submit feedback about their dining experience. They should rate food quality, service speed, and overall satisfaction on a 1-5 scale, plus leave optional comments and upload photos. When someone gives us 3 stars or lower, immediately alert our manager via Slack so we can follow up personally. I want to see all feedback in a dashboard so I can track trends and improve our service.
```

**Yoga Studio:**

```
I run a yoga studio and need clients to book classes online and pay in advance. They should see available class times, choose their preferred instructor, and pay a deposit. When someone books, send them a confirmation email with class details and add the appointment to our Google Calendar. I want to track which classes are most popular so I can schedule more of them.
```

**Consultant:**

```
I'm a business consultant and need potential clients to request proposals through my website. They should fill out their business challenges, budget range, and timeline, plus upload any relevant documents. When someone submits a request, send me an instant Slack notification and add their information to my CRM. I want to track which types of projects people request most so I can focus my marketing.
```

**Your turn:** Write your app description using the template above.

## Step 3: Build Your App with Genesis (1 minute)

Now the magic happens - Genesis turns your description into a working app.

* **📁 File Management** - Handles uploads and document storage

***

## Step 3.5: Add Context Files (Optional - 30 seconds)

**Supercharge your app with reference materials.** Genesis can analyze uploaded files to better understand your brand, requirements, and design preferences.

### **Why Add Context?**

Genesis becomes significantly more powerful when you provide reference materials:

* **🎨 Brand Consistency** - Upload logos, color palettes, and style guides

```

### **Types of Context Files**

| File Type           | Purpose         | Examples                              |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Brand Assets**    | Visual identity | Logos, color palettes, fonts          |
| **Reference Forms** | Data structure  | Existing forms, surveys, applications |
| **Screenshots**     | UI inspiration  | Website designs, competitor apps      |
| **Documents**       | Requirements    | Business rules, process flows, SOPs   |

### **File Upload Tips**

* **PDF files** work great for brand guidelines and documentation
* **Images** (PNG/JPG) perfect for logos and screenshots
* **Text files** useful for code snippets and requirements
* **All uploaded files** are stored in your project's Media tab for future reference
