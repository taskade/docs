# Living Systems That Transform Business

**Living Software. Living DNA. Living Intelligence.**

**Build Without Permission.**\
**One Prompt. One App.**\
**Imagine it. Run it live.**\
**Powered by your workspace.**

Genesis turns plain English into a live application.\
It builds on the same data, agents, and automations you already use.

### What Genesis can build

* **Web apps**: dashboards, portals, lightweight CRMs
* **Websites**: landing pages with live content and AI
* **Internal tools**: admin panels, trackers, ops consoles
* **Data collection**: lead capture, intake forms, surveys

See templates: [Living System Examples & Templates](examples-and-templates.md).

### How Genesis works (short version)

1. You describe an app and its workflow.
2. Genesis generates a UI and data model.
3. The app runs on your workspace, not a separate backend.

The key idea is reuse.\
Your apps reuse the same **memory**, **intelligence**, and **motion**.

### Workspace DNA

Workspace DNA is how Taskade stays one system.\
It connects data (memory), agents (intelligence), and automations (motion).

#### 1) Living Memory (data)

Projects and databases store structured knowledge.\
This is what agents read and automations update.

* [Project Views Mastery](../workspaces/project-views.md)

#### 2) Living Intelligence (agents)

AI agents reason with workspace context.\
They draft, classify, summarize, and run tools across projects.

Start here:

* [Living Intelligence Overview](../ai-features/)
* [AI Agents Getting Started](../ai-features/ai-agents-getting-started.md)

#### 3) Living Motion (automations)

Automations execute event-driven workflows.\
They connect Taskade to external tools and services.
