# Chapter 3: AI Agents - Your Digital Team

Incredible! You've built your workspace foundation and created flexible project containers. Now let's add the **intelligence layer**‚ÄîAI agents that act like specialized team members, each trained for specific roles in your business.

## What Problem Do AI Agents Solve?

**Traditional AI tools are generic and forgetful:**
- ChatGPT forgets your business context after each conversation
- Generic AI doesn't understand your specific processes or terminology
- You have to explain your business repeatedly to get useful help

**AI agents in Taskade solve this by becoming permanent, specialized team members** who learn your business, remember your preferences, and work alongside your human team members.

## What is an AI Agent? (Your Digital Team Member)

An AI agent is a **specialized digital assistant** trained on your business knowledge, processes, and preferences. Unlike generic AI chatbots, agents become part of your team with specific roles and expertise.
