They should be able to rate food quality, service speed, and overall satisfaction on a 1-5 scale, plus leave optional comments and upload photos. When someone gives us 3 stars or lower, automatically send a Slack message to our manager channel so we can follow up personally."
```

### Step 4: Live and Evolving
