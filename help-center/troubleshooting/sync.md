## üîÑ Understanding Taskade Sync

### **How Sync Works**

Taskade uses **real-time synchronization** powered by operational transformation:

```yaml
Sync Architecture:
  Real-time Updates:
    - Changes appear instantly (typically <200ms)
    - Conflict-free collaborative editing
    - Automatic conflict resolution
    - Offline changes sync when reconnected
  
  Data Flow:
    - Device ‚Üí Taskade Servers ‚Üí All Other Devices
    - WebSocket connections for instant updates
    - Background sync for reliability
    - Local caching for offline access
```

### **What Gets Synced**
- ‚úÖ **Tasks and Projects**: All content and structure changes
- ‚úÖ **Custom Fields**: Field values and configurations  
- ‚úÖ **Assignments**: Task assignments and team member changes
- ‚úÖ **Due Dates**: All scheduling and deadline information
- ‚úÖ **Comments**: Team communication and feedback
- ‚úÖ **File Attachments**: Documents, images, and media files
- ‚úÖ **View Preferences**: Your preferred project views and settings
- ‚úÖ **Workspace Settings**: Team configurations and permissions
