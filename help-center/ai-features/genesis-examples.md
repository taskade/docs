## 🔧 Technical Implementation Tips

### Making Your Genesis Apps More Effective

**1. Be Specific About Data Fields**
Instead of "collect customer info," specify exactly what you need:
```
"Collect: full name, email, phone, company, job title, industry, company size (1-10, 11-50, 51-200, 200+), current challenges, budget range, decision timeline"
```

**2. Define Clear Workflows**
Map out the exact steps and triggers:
```
"When form is submitted → AI categorizes lead → Creates task for sales rep → Sends welcome email to lead → If no follow-up in 24 hours, alert sales manager"
```

**3. Include Business Rules**
Specify the logic your business uses:
```
"Mark as high priority if: budget > $50K AND timeline < 60 days AND decision-maker = Yes"
```

**4. Plan for Edge Cases**
Think about what could go wrong:
```
"If customer uploads file larger than 10MB, compress automatically. If AI can't categorize request, route to general support queue. If form is submitted outside business hours, send immediate auto-response with expected response time."
```
