# Getting Started with Taskade Genesis

Build complete AI-powered applications from a single prompt - no coding required! Genesis transforms your business ideas into working apps with databases, smart AI agents, and automated workflows.

## What is Genesis?

Genesis is Taskade's **App Builder** that creates complete business applications just by describing what you need. Think of it as having a team of expert developers, designers, and business analysts who can build exactly what you want in minutes - no technical skills required!

**What Genesis Creates:**
- üìä **Smart Databases** - Structured projects that store your app's data
- ü§ñ **AI Assistants** - Intelligent agents that understand your business
- ‚ö° **Automated Workflows** - Actions that happen automatically
- üåê **Public Web Apps** - Shareable interfaces your users can access

## Your First Genesis App in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Access Genesis (30 seconds)

1. Go to [taskade.com](https://taskade.com) and sign in
2. Look for the **"Create with AI"** prompt box at the top
3. You're ready to build!

### Step 2: Describe Your App (2 minutes)

Be specific about what you want to build. Here's the magic formula:

**What + Who + When + Action**

‚úÖ **Good Example:**
```
"Create a customer feedback system where restaurant guests can:
- Rate food quality, service speed, and atmosphere (1-5 stars)
- Leave optional written comments
- Upload photos of their meal
- Get a thank you message after submitting

When someone rates us 3 stars or lower, immediately send a Slack alert to our manager so we can follow up personally. Store all feedback in a dashboard where we can see trends and respond to individual reviews."
```

‚ùå **Too Vague:**
```
"I need a feedback form"
```

### Step 3: Let Genesis Build (1 minute)

1. **Paste your description** into the prompt box
2. **Press Enter** and watch Genesis work
3. **See the magic happen** - Genesis creates all components automatically

You'll see Genesis building:

- **Automations** (your app's workflows)
- **Public Interface** (your app's web page)

### Step 4: Test Your App (1 minute)

1. **Click "Preview"** to see your live app
2. **Fill out the form** as if you're a real customer
3. **Check your notifications** (Slack, email, etc.)
4. **View your dashboard** to see the data

### Step 5: Share Your App (30 seconds)
