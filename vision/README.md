# The HyperCard of the AI Era

In 1987, Apple released HyperCard, a piece of software that fundamentally changed personal computing. For the first time, it gave non-programmers the power to create their own interactive software—from simple databases to complex adventure games—using a simple, card-based metaphor. It democratized creation.

Today, we stand at a similar inflection point with artificial intelligence. The power of large language models is immense, but harnessing it to build real, useful applications remains complex.

**This is where Taskade comes in.**

Our vision is to create the **HyperCard of the AI Era**. We are building a platform that empowers anyone—from solo entrepreneurs to enterprise teams—to build powerful, AI-driven web applications without writing a line of code.

| Then (HyperCard)             | Now (Taskade)                                       |

| Stack of Cards               | **Subspace as a Web App**                             |
| Fields & Buttons (UI)        | **Taskade Projects (Data + UI)**                      |
| HyperTalk (Scripting)        | **AI Agents & Automations (Logic)**                   |
| Local, Standalone Apps       | **Cloud-native, Collaborative Apps**                  |
| Floppy Disk Sharing          | **One-Click Sharing & Embedding**                       |

### From Productivity to Creation

Taskade began as a tool to enhance productivity. Now, we are evolving into a platform for creation.

### The Philosophy: Instant Value, Infinite Extensibility

Our core philosophy is simple:

1.  **Instant Value:** Every app you generate should be useful in under 30 seconds. It will come with a beautiful interface, sample data, and working logic, ready to be tested and shared.
2.  **Infinite Extensibility:** An app is just the beginning. You can "look under the hood" to customize the data structure, refine the AI agent's behavior, and build sophisticated automation workflows. You are never locked in.

Just as HyperCard unleashed a wave of creativity by making software development accessible, Taskade is designed to unleash the next wave of innovation by making AI app development accessible to all.
