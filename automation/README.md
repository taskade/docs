# Taskade Automations Overview

Taskade Automations let you connect 100+ tools and services into intelligent workflows that combine **human action**, **AI agents**, and **real-time execution.**

Think of automations as the nervous system of your AI-powered applications. They bridge the gap between your app's knowledge (Projects), intelligence (Agents), and the outside world, creating seamless workflows that can:

- **React to Events**: Form submissions, webhooks, schedules, project changes
- **Process with AI**: Analyze, categorize, summarize, and make decisions
- **Take Action**: Create tasks, send notifications, update external systems
- **Loop Back**: Update your knowledge base with new insights

## How Automations Work

Automations are composed of three key components:

### 1. **Triggers** ‚Äì When Something Happens
- **Form Submitted**: User fills out a public form
- **Webhook Received**: External service sends data to your app
- **Schedule**: Time-based triggers (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Project Event**: Task completed, member added, content changed
- **Agent Event**: Conversation started, command executed

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Choose Your Trigger
What event should start your automation?
- Public form for lead capture
- Webhook from external service
- Schedule for recurring tasks
- Project event for workflow automation

### Step 2: Design Your Workflow
Map out the sequence of actions:
- What data needs processing?
- Which AI agents should be involved?
- What external systems need updates?
- Who should be notified?

### Step 3: Configure Integrations
Connect to external services:
- Authenticate with OAuth or API keys
- Map data fields between systems
- Set up error handling and retries

### Step 4: Test & Deploy
- Run through with sample data
- Monitor performance and errors
- Iterate based on results

## Variables & Data Flow

{% hint style="info" %}
Variables allow data to flow seamlessly between automation components. They enable dynamic, context-aware workflows that adapt to your data.
{% endhint %}

### Variable Syntax

Variables are referenced using the `@` symbol and allow you to access:
- **Trigger data**: `@trigger.form.name`, `@trigger.webhook.data`
- **Step results**: `@step.3.response`, `@step.1.output`
- **System data**: `@current.date`, `@current.user`
- **Custom fields**: `@task.priority`, `@project.status`

**Example:**
```
Trigger: Form submitted (name, email, priority)
Action: Create task titled "@trigger.form.name - Support Request"
Condition: If "@trigger.form.priority" equals "urgent"
  ‚Üí Send immediate Slack notification
  ‚Üí Assign to escalation team
```

### Data Types & Transformations

Variables support multiple data types:
- **Text/Strings**: Names, descriptions, content
- **Numbers**: Quantities, scores, percentages
- **Dates**: Due dates, timestamps, schedules
- **Arrays**: Lists of items, multiple selections
- **Objects**: Complex data structures from APIs

**Transformation Functions:**
- `{{variable | uppercase}}` - Convert to uppercase
- `{{variable | date:"YYYY-MM-DD"}}` - Format dates
- `{{variable | length}}` - Get array/string length
- `{{variable | split:","}}` - Split strings into arrays

## Advanced Features

### **Conditional Logic**
```json
{
  "condition": "{{form.priority}} === 'high'",
  "then": [...],
  "else": [...]
}
```

### **Multi-Step AI Workflows**
Chain multiple agents together for complex processing

### **Human-in-the-Loop**
Request approvals and reviews before taking action

### **Error Handling**
Retry failed actions and notify on persistent errors

### **Data Transformation**
Clean, format, and enrich data as it flows through your system

## API Access (Coming Soon)

While automations are currently managed through the Taskade interface, we're building API endpoints for programmatic control:

```bash
# Create automation (planned)
curl -X POST https://www.taskade.com/api/v1/automations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Lead Processor",
    "trigger": {"type": "form_submission"},
    "actions": [...]
  }'
```

## üöÄ Advanced Automation Patterns

### **Multi-Agent Orchestration**

Create sophisticated workflows where multiple AI agents collaborate on complex tasks:

```yaml
Content Production Pipeline:
  Trigger: "New blog topic submitted via form"
  
  Agent 1 - Research Agent:
    - Analyze topic and gather relevant data
    - Create research brief with sources
    - Pass findings to Content Agent
  
  Agent 2 - Content Agent:
    - Generate article outline based on research
    - Write first draft using research data
    - Pass draft to Editor Agent
  
  Agent 3 - Editor Agent:
    - Review content for quality and accuracy
    - Suggest improvements and edits
    - Finalize content for publication
  
  Final Actions:
    - Create task in Editorial Calendar
    - Notify marketing team via Slack
    - Schedule social media promotion
```

### **Conditional Logic Workflows**

Build intelligent decision trees that adapt based on data:

| **Condition** | **Action Path** | **Business Logic** |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Lead Score > 80** | Route to Sales Team | Hot prospects get immediate attention |
| **Lead Score 50-80** | Nurture Campaign | Warm leads need more engagement |
| **Lead Score < 50** | Educational Content | Cold leads need value-first approach |

### **Error Handling & Recovery**

Build resilient automations that handle failures gracefully:

```yaml
Robust Email Campaign:
  Primary Action: "Send via Mailchimp"
  
  Error Handling:
    - If Mailchimp fails ‚Üí Try SendGrid backup
    - If both fail ‚Üí Create manual task for team
    - Log all attempts in error tracking project
    - Send alert to admin via Slack
  
  Success Tracking:
    - Update campaign metrics in dashboard
    - Create follow-up tasks based on engagement
    - Trigger next sequence in nurture campaign
```

### **Data Transformation Pipelines**

Process and enrich data as it flows through your system:

```yaml
Customer Data Enrichment:
  Input: "Raw form submission"
  
  Transformation Steps:
    1. Validate email format and domain
    2. Enrich with company data from Clearbit
    3. Score lead based on ICP criteria
    4. Categorize by industry and company size
    5. Assign to appropriate sales rep
  
  Output: "Fully qualified lead record"
```

### **Agentic Automation Loops**

Create self-improving systems that learn and adapt:

```yaml
Customer Success Automation:
  Continuous Loop:
    1. Monitor customer health scores
    2. AI Agent analyzes usage patterns
    3. Predicts churn risk using historical data
    4. Automatically creates intervention tasks
    5. Tracks intervention success rates
    6. Updates prediction model with results
    7. Improves future predictions
```
