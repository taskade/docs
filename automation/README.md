# Taskade Automations Overview

Taskade Automations let you connect 100+ tools and services into intelligent workflows that combine **human action**, **AI agents**, and **real-time execution.**

Think of automations as the nervous system of your AI-powered applications. They bridge the gap between your app's knowledge (Projects), intelligence (Agents), and the outside world, creating seamless workflows that can:

- **React to Events**: Form submissions, webhooks, schedules, project changes
- **Process with AI**: Analyze, categorize, summarize, and make decisions
- **Take Action**: Create tasks, send notifications, update external systems
- **Loop Back**: Update your knowledge base with new insights

## How Automations Work

Automations are composed of three key components:

### 1. **Triggers** – When Something Happens
- **Form Submitted**: User fills out a public form
- **Webhook Received**: External service sends data to your app
- **Schedule**: Time-based triggers (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Project Event**: Task completed, member added, content changed
- **Agent Event**: Conversation started, command executed

### 2. **Actions** – Do Something
- **Create Tasks**: Add structured data to your Knowledge Layer
- **Run Agent Commands**: Process information with AI
- **Send Notifications**: Slack, email, SMS, Discord
- **Update External Systems**: CRM, spreadsheets, databases
- **Call APIs**: Custom webhooks and HTTP requests

### 3. **Intelligence** – AI-Powered Decision Making
- **Content Analysis**: Sentiment, classification, extraction
- **Smart Routing**: Assign tasks based on content and context
- **Data Enrichment**: Enhance incoming data with research and insights
- **Quality Control**: Review and approve AI-generated content
