# Triggers Reference

Triggers are the "if" part of automation workflows - they define the events that initiate automated actions. Taskade provides a comprehensive set of triggers that monitor for task changes, project events, external integrations, and scheduled conditions. Each trigger provides contextual data that can be used in subsequent automation actions.

{% hint style="success" %}
Triggers act as the intelligent sensors of your automation system, detecting events across Taskade and external services to initiate workflows that keep your processes running smoothly.
{% endhint %}

## Understanding Triggers

Triggers are predefined conditions that monitor for specific events or changes. When these conditions are met, they initiate automated action sequences. Triggers provide contextual data that can be referenced in subsequent automation steps.

### Trigger Types by Category

**Task Events**: Monitor task lifecycle changes (creation, completion, assignment, due dates)
**Project Events**: Track project-level changes (completion, status updates)
**Time Events**: Schedule-based or time-sensitive triggers (due dates, schedules)
**Collaboration Events**: Monitor team interactions (comments, mentions)
**Data Events**: Track data changes (custom fields, form submissions)
**External Events**: Integration-based triggers from external services
**AI Events**: Agent and AI-related triggers
**Control Flow**: Workflow control triggers (delays, manual triggers)

Triggers are events that start automations. They monitor for specific conditions and launch your automation workflows when those conditions are met. Each trigger provides context data that can be used in subsequent actions.

|---------|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| `webhook.custom` | Custom webhook endpoint | `url`, `method`, `auth` | External integrations |
| `webhook.custom` | Custom webhook endpoint | `url`, `method`, `auth` | External integrations |
| `webhook.ifttt` | IFTTT webhook | `iftttKey`, `event` | IFTTT triggers |

### API Triggers

| Trigger | Description | Configuration | Example Use Case |
|---------|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| `api.rest` | REST API endpoint | `endpoint`, `method`, `auth` | Custom API calls |
| `api.graphql` | GraphQL subscription | `query`, `variables` | Real-time updates |
| `api.websocket` | WebSocket connection | `url`, `protocol` | Live data streams |

## Trigger Configuration

### Authentication

Most external triggers require authentication:

```json
{
  "trigger": {
    "type": "slack.messageReceived",
    "auth": {
      "type": "oauth2",
      "token": "xoxb-your-token"
    },
    "channel": "#general"
  }
}
```

### Filters

Apply filters to trigger only on specific conditions:

```json
{
  "trigger": {
    "type": "form.submitted",
    "filters": {
      "form_name": "Contact Form",
      "priority": "high"
    }
  }
}
```

### Rate Limiting

Control trigger frequency to prevent spam:

```json
{
  "trigger": {
    "type": "email.received",
    "rateLimit": {
      "maxPerMinute": 10,
      "maxPerHour": 100
    }
  }
}
```

## Data Context

### Trigger Data Structure

Each trigger provides structured data:

```json
{
  "trigger": {
    "type": "form.submitted",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "data": {
      "form": {
        "id": "form_123",
        "name": "Contact Form",
        "url": "https://example.com/contact"
      },
      "responses": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john@example.com",
        "message": "Need help with integration"
      },
      "submitter": {
        "ip": "192.168.1.1",
        "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
        "location": "New York, NY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Using Trigger Data

Access trigger data in actions using template variables:

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "taskade.createTask",
      "title": "{{trigger.data.responses.name}} - {{trigger.data.responses.message}}",
      "assignee": "support@company.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Advanced Trigger Features

### Conditional Triggers

Only trigger when specific conditions are met:

```json
{
  "trigger": {
    "type": "taskade.taskCreated",
    "condition": "{{task.priority}} === 'high' && {{task.assignee}} === null"
  }
}
```

### Batch Triggers

Process multiple events together:

```json
{
  "trigger": {
    "type": "email.received",
    "batch": {
      "size": 10,
      "timeout": 300
    }
  }
}
```

### Debounced Triggers

Prevent rapid-fire triggers:

```json
{
  "trigger": {
    "type": "sheets.rowAdded",
    "debounce": {
      "delay": 5000,
      "key": "{{sheet.id}}"
    }
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Retry Logic

Retry failed triggers automatically:

```json
{
  "trigger": {
    "type": "webhook.received",
    "retry": {
      "maxAttempts": 3,
      "backoff": "exponential"
    }
  }
}
```

### Dead Letter Queue

Handle permanently failed triggers:

```json
{
  "trigger": {
    "type": "api.rest",
    "deadLetter": {
      "enabled": true,
      "action": "notify_admin"
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing Triggers

### Manual Testing

Test triggers with sample data:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.taskade.com/webhooks/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "trigger": "form.submitted",
    "data": {
      "name": "Test User",
      "email": "test@example.com"
    }
  }'
```

### Simulation Mode

Run triggers in simulation mode:

```json
{
  "trigger": {
    "type": "schedule.daily",
    "simulate": true,
    "simulationData": {
      "date": "2024-01-15",
      "time": "09:00"
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Use Specific Filters**
Filter triggers to reduce noise and improve performance.

### 2. **Handle Errors Gracefully**
Always include error handling for external triggers.

### 3. **Monitor Trigger Health**
Set up monitoring for trigger failures and performance.

### 4. **Secure Webhooks**
Use authentication and validation for webhook triggers.

### 5. **Test Thoroughly**
Test triggers with various scenarios and edge cases.
