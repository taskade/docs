## 🎯 The Anatomy of a Great Prompt

Understanding what makes a Genesis prompt effective will help you build better apps faster.

### **What Is a Prompt?**

A prompt is your conversation with Genesis. It's how you describe your business problem and the solution you envision. Think of it as explaining your needs to a trusted colleague who can build anything.

### **Essential Prompt Components**

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Problem Statement** | What business challenge are you solving? | "Customers keep calling to book appointments when we're busy" |
| **Core Functionality** | What should the app do? | "Create an online booking system with calendar availability" |
| **User Experience** | How should people interact with it? | "Simple form with service selection and time slots" |
| **Automation** | What should happen automatically? | "Send confirmation emails and reminder texts" |
| **Data Structure** | What information needs to be captured? | "Customer contact, service type, date/time, special requests" |

### **Prompt Quality Levels**

#### **❌ Weak Prompt**
```
"Make a booking app"
```
*Too vague - Genesis doesn't know what to build*

#### **⚠️ Basic Prompt**
```
"Create a booking system for appointments"
```
*Better but lacks detail about functionality*

#### **✅ Strong Prompt**
```
"Build an appointment booking system where customers select services, 
choose available time slots, provide contact info, and receive 
confirmation emails. Include a calendar view for staff to manage 
bookings and send reminder texts 24 hours before appointments."
```
*Clear, specific, includes user experience and automation*

## 🌟 "Wow Moment" Prompts

*These create instant user delight and viral sharing - the kind of results that make people say "how did it do that?"*
