{% endhint %}

### 💬 What is a Prompt?

A prompt is simply the description of what you want to build. Think of it as explaining your app idea to a smart colleague who can build it for you. The clearer your explanation, the better your app turns out.

### 1. Set Clear Objectives

Explain who uses the app and why it matters to your business:

- **"My restaurant staff needs to track inventory daily and get alerts when we're running low on key ingredients."**
- **"My real estate team needs to track property leads and automatically follow up with prospects who haven't responded in 48 hours."**
- **"Our consulting clients need a portal where they can access project deliverables, schedule meetings, and track billable hours."**

### 2. Describe Specific Outcomes

Be specific about functionality. Vague requests get vague results:

- **"Customers upload project files, see progress updates, message our team, and download final files. Everyone gets notifications for each step."**
- **"Employees submit expense reports with receipts, managers approve or reject them, accounting gets notified, and reimbursements are tracked until payment."**
- **"Students watch course videos, complete quizzes, track their progress, and receive certificates upon completion. Instructors can see engagement analytics."**

### 3. Explain the User Journey

Walk Genesis through how people will actually use your app:

- **"New users sign up, answer a few questions about their needs, get matched with relevant resources, then receive weekly personalized updates."**
- **"Customers browse our service catalog, request quotes, upload requirements, review proposals, approve work, and rate their experience afterward."**
- **"Job applicants create profiles, upload resumes, apply for positions, take skills assessments, schedule interviews, and get status updates throughout the process."**

### 4. Break Down Complex Ideas

For bigger projects, use simple numbered steps:

- **"1. Show real-time sales on a dashboard 2. Let users filter by product type 3. Add export buttons for reports 4. Send alerts when sales drop"**
- **"1. Collect customer feedback through forms 2. Categorize responses by department 3. Route urgent issues to management 4. Generate monthly satisfaction reports 5. Send follow-up surveys automatically"**
- **"1. Display available appointment slots 2. Let clients book and pay online 3. Send confirmation emails and calendar invites 4. Allow rescheduling with 24-hour notice 5. Collect feedback after appointments"**

### 5. Connect Existing Tools

Tell Genesis what you're already using so it can connect everything:

- **"Import customer data from Google Sheets and send automated email notifications via Gmail. Connect to Slack for team alerts and let customers update their information directly in the app."**
- **"Connect to WhatsApp Business for client communication. Integrate with our existing project database for customer records."**
- **"Pull inventory data from Google Sheets, connect to our accounting project for cost tracking, and send low-stock alerts to our Slack channel."**

### 6. Define the Communication Tone

Your app should sound like your business. Tell Genesis how to communicate:

- **"Keep it professional but friendly, like talking to customers in person. Make error messages helpful, not technical."**
- **"Use an encouraging, supportive tone like a personal fitness coach. Celebrate user achievements and make setbacks feel manageable."**
- **"Sound like a trusted financial advisor—authoritative but not intimidating. Use simple language to explain complex topics and always emphasize security."**

### 7. Specify Look & Feel

Tell Genesis how you want your app to look—colors, images, and overall vibe:

- **"Use a clean, modern design with our brand colors: navy blue headers and bright green accent buttons. Include our company logo in the top left. Make it feel professional but approachable, like our website."**
- **"Create a warm, welcoming design with soft colors—think spa-like with cream backgrounds and sage green accents. Use rounded corners and gentle shadows to feel calming and trustworthy."**
- **"Bold and energetic design with bright orange and black colors. Make it feel like a fitness app with strong typography and high-contrast buttons that motivate action."**

### 8. Define Access Permissions

Apps need different permission levels. Be clear about who can do what:

- **"Staff can view all projects and add updates. Clients only see their own projects and can't edit. Managers access everything plus analytics."**
- **"Students can access their courses and submit assignments. Instructors can grade work and message students. Administrators can manage all users and see system-wide reports."**
- **"Regular employees can log hours and submit requests. Department heads can approve their team's requests. HR can access all employee data and generate company reports."**

### 9. Plan for Easy Iteration

Your app is not set in stone. Refine it and iterate with simple follow-up requests:

- **"The form works great—can you add file upload after the description and make the submit button bigger?"**
- **"Love the dashboard, but can you move the notifications to the top right and make the charts more colorful?"**
- **"The booking system is perfect, but can you add a text reminder 24 hours before appointments and let customers reschedule themselves?"**

### 10. Reference Similar Apps

Mention apps or websites with features you like:

- **"Make the dashboard layout similar to Stripe's interface—clean cards with key metrics up top and detailed tables below. But simplify the navigation for less tech-savvy users."**
- **"Create a course layout like Udemy—video player on the left, course outline on the right, with a clean progress bar. But make it feel more personal and less corporate."**
- **"Design the booking interface like Calendly—simple date/time selection with instant confirmation. But add our branding and include service descriptions for each appointment type."**

### 11. Provide Specific Examples

Demonstrate workflows by describing complete scenarios:

- **"Customer inquiry: Contact form submitted → Create lead record → Send welcome email → Notify sales team → Set 3-day follow-up reminder"**
- **"New employee: HR creates profile → Send welcome email with login → Employee completes onboarding forms → Manager gets notification → Training modules assigned automatically"**
- **"Order process: Customer places order → Inventory updated → Payment processed → Shipping label created → Customer gets tracking info → Follow-up review request sent after delivery"**

### 12. Experiment Boldly

Genesis saves your work automatically. Try bold changes and see what happens:

- **"Let's completely redesign the homepage layout" or "Remove the entire pricing section and replace it with a simple contact form."**
- **"What if we made this a single-page app instead of multiple screens?" or "Can we turn this form into a conversational chatbot experience?"**
- **"Let's try a completely different approach—make this feel like a game with points and achievements instead of a boring business tool."**

## 🎯 The Anatomy of a Great Prompt

Understanding what makes a Genesis prompt effective will help you build better apps faster.

### **What Is a Prompt?**

A prompt is your conversation with Genesis. It's how you describe your business problem and the solution you envision. Think of it as explaining your needs to a trusted colleague who can build anything.

### **Essential Prompt Components**

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Problem Statement** | What business challenge are you solving? | "Customers keep calling to book appointments when we're busy" |

| **User Experience** | How should people interact with it? | "Simple form with service selection and time slots" |
| **Automation** | What should happen automatically? | "Send confirmation emails and reminder texts" |
| **Data Structure** | What information needs to be captured? | "Customer contact, service type, date/time, special requests" |

### **Prompt Quality Levels**

#### **❌ Weak Prompt**
```

```
*Too vague - Genesis doesn't know what to build*

```
"Create a booking system for appointments"
```
*Better but lacks detail about functionality*

#### **✅ Strong Prompt**
```
"Build an appointment booking system where customers select services, 
choose available time slots, provide contact info, and receive 
confirmation emails. Include a calendar view for staff to manage 
bookings and send reminder texts 24 hours before appointments."
```
*Clear, specific, includes user experience and automation*

## 🌟 "Wow Moment" Prompts

*These create instant user delight and viral sharing - the kind of results that make people say "how did it do that?"*
