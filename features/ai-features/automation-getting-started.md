# Getting Started with Automation

Put your routine work on autopilot! Taskade's automation feature helps you save time by automatically handling repetitive tasks.

## What is Automation?

Think of automation like setting up dominoes – when the first one falls (something happens), it makes all the others fall in sequence (actions get triggered automatically).

**Simple examples:**
- ✅ When someone completes a task → notify the team in Slack
- ✅ When a form is submitted → create a new project and assign it to someone
- ✅ When a deadline approaches → send reminder emails
- ✅ When inventory is low → order more supplies automatically

## How It Works: "If This, Then That"

Every automation follows this simple pattern:

**🔥 Trigger** (If this happens...)
- Someone submits a form
- A task gets completed
- It's 9 AM every Monday
- A new customer signs up

**⚡ Action** (Then do that...)
- Send a Slack message
- Create a new project
- Send an email
- Update a spreadsheet

Make your automations smarter with AI actions:

## Variables: Making Automations Personal

Use variables to include specific information in your actions:

**@trigger.taskName** → The name of the completed task  
**@trigger.userName** → Who completed the task  
**@trigger.projectName** → Which project it belongs to  
**@trigger.dueDate** → When it was due

**Example message:** "🎉 Great job @trigger.userName! You completed '@trigger.taskName' in the @trigger.projectName project."
