# Getting Started with AI Agents

Transform your workspace with smart AI assistants that understand your business and can handle tasks automatically!

## What are AI Agents?

Think of AI Agents as smart team members who:
- 🧠 **Learn your business** by reading your documents and projects
- 🤖 **Answer questions** about your work and processes
- ⚡ **Take actions** like creating tasks, sending emails, or updating spreadsheets  
- 🔄 **Work 24/7** without breaks, weekends, or vacations

**Real example:** Your "Customer Service Agent" can instantly answer questions about your products, create support tickets, and even draft response emails - all based on your existing knowledge base.

## When Should You Create an AI Agent?

Create an agent if you:

✅ **Repeat the same tasks** multiple times per week  
✅ **Spend 2+ hours weekly** on similar activities  
✅ **Answer the same questions** over and over  
✅ **Need help** with research, writing, or analysis  
✅ **Want to streamline** team processes
