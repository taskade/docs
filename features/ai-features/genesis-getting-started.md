## 4 Steps to a Live App

Getting your app off the ground is really simple. Follow these four steps to transform any challenge into working solution that works out of the box.

### Step 1: Start with Your Idea

The best apps solve real problems in your business. Before you even open Genesis, think about what's slowing you down or what could work better.

Ask yourself:
- What business problem am I trying to solve?
- Who will use this app (customers, employees, partners)?
- What information do they need to input?
- What actions should happen automatically?
- How will this improve my business processes?

Do you already have your answers? Great! Let's move to the next step.

### Step 2: Let Genesis Build It

When you first open Genesis, you'll see a text area where you can describe what you want to create. Simply describe it as you would to a colleague. The more specific you are, the better the result.

### Step 3: Test and Iterate

Once Genesis builds your initial app, you'll see it come to life with all the professional features you need. But this is just the beginning. Now you can refine it.

Switch to the **Preview** tab to interact with your live application.

**Test the core functionality:**
- Fill out forms as if you're a real user
- Check automated notifications and workflows
- Verify data is being stored correctly
- Try different user scenarios

Now make it uniquely yours. Making changes is simple. Just describe what you want to adjust. Genesis understands business language and implements changes immediately.

### Step 4: Share It!

Your app is ready for the real world! You've built something that solves a real business problem, and now it's time to put it in front of actual users.

Getting it live is simple:
1. Click **"Publish"** to make your app public
2. Copy the shareable link
3. Set access permissions if needed
4. Share with your intended users

Your app is instantly available and ready for users!

**Share your success story and get featured:**
- Post about your app in Taskade community forums
- Share screenshots and results
- Tag @taskade on social media
- Help others learn from your experience

## Enhanced Prompts for Better Results

Not sure how to describe what you want? Use these techniques to create better prompts:

### Use Prompt Enhancement

The Enhance Prompt feature takes your rough idea and turns it into a detailed, specific request that Genesis can act on. Start with a basic description, and let Genesis help you refine it.

### Your First Prompt

Begin with something simple but specific. Focus on one clear business need rather than trying to build everything at once.

### Follow-Up Prompts

Once your app is working, use follow-up prompts to add features:
- "Add email notifications when new submissions arrive"
- "Include a dashboard showing response trends"
- "Add user authentication for secure access"
- "Create automated follow-up sequences"

## What is Genesis? (Technical Overview)

Genesis is Taskade's **App Builder** that creates complete business applications just by describing what you need. Think of it as having a team of expert developers, designers, and business analysts who can build exactly what you want in minutes - no technical skills required!

```
"I need a feedback form"
```
