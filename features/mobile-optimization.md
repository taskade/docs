### **Quick Add Widget: Instant Productivity**

The Quick Add widget is a powerful companion tool that lives on your device's home screen, enabling instant task creation without opening the main app.

#### **The "Magic Moment"**
*You're at the grocery store and remember you need to follow up with a client. Instead of opening apps and navigating menus, you:*
1. **Tap the widget** on your home screen
2. **Speak naturally**: "Follow up with Sarah about the project proposal tomorrow at 2pm"
3. **Done** - Task created, date parsed, reminder set, project assigned

**That's it. No friction, no complexity, just instant capture.**

#### **Widget Features**
- **Home screen access** - Add tasks instantly from your device's home screen
- **Smart date recognition** - Natural language processing for dates and times ("next Friday", "in 2 hours", "tomorrow at 3pm")
- **Project selection** - Quick access to your most-used projects with smart suggestions
- **Voice input** - Speak your tasks for hands-free creation with 95%+ accuracy
- **Offline support** - Tasks sync automatically when connection is restored

#### **Natural Language Date Processing (NLP)**

Taskade uses advanced natural language processing to speed up date entry. Simply type natural phrases and they're automatically converted to proper dates:

| Natural Language Input | Converted To |
|------------------------|--------------|
| **today** / **tomorrow** | Current/next day |
| **yesterday** | Previous day |
| **next week** | 7 days from today |
| **last Monday** / **next Monday** | Previous/upcoming Monday |
| **May 1st** | May 1st of current year |
| **May 1st 5 pm** | May 1st at 5:00 PM |
| **1st May 2023** | May 1st, 2023 |
| **May 1st 2023 at 5 pm** | May 1st, 2023 at 5:00 PM |
| **5 pm May 1st** | May 1st at 5:00 PM |
| **1st May 2023 5 pm** | May 1st, 2023 at 5:00 PM |

**Examples in Action:**
- "Call client **tomorrow at 2pm**" â†’ Sets due date to tomorrow 2:00 PM
- "Review report **next Friday**" â†’ Sets due date to upcoming Friday  
- "Meeting **May 15th 9am**" â†’ Sets due date to May 15th at 9:00 AM
