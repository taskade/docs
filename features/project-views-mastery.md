```yaml
Your Data Foundation:
  - Tasks and projects stored in flexible tree structure
  - Custom fields, dates, assignees, and notes
  - Rich content including files, images, and links
  - Real-time collaboration and sync across all views

8 Different Views:
  - Each view emphasizes different aspects of your data
  - Switch instantly without data conversion or loss
  - Collaborative editing works seamlessly across all views
  - Choose the best view for each situation and workflow
```
