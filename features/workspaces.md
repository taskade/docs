# Workspaces

Workspaces are the foundational containers that organize your teams, projects, and resources in Taskade. Each workspace creates an isolated collaborative environment with dedicated members, customizable settings, and granular permission controls.

## 🏢 What is a Workspace?

**Key Benefits**
- **Organized Collaboration**: Keep different teams and projects clearly separated
- **Secure Access Control**: Manage who can see and edit what content
- **Unified Communication**: Centralized chat, video calls, and notifications
- **Seamless Integration**: AI agents, automations, and templates shared across workspace

## 📁 Workspaces vs. Team Folders (Formerly Teams)

### Understanding the Hierarchy

**Taskade's organizational structure provides flexible ways to group and manage your work:**

```
Organization Level
├── 🏢 Workspace (Top-level container)
│   ├── 🏠 Home Space (Default, cannot be deleted)
│   ├── 📁 Team Folder A (Client projects)
│   │   ├── 📄 Project 1
│   │   ├── 📄 Project 2
│   │   └── 🤖 AI Agent
│   ├── 📁 Team Folder B (Internal projects)
│   │   ├── 📄 Project 3
│   │   └── 📊 Dashboard
│   └── 📁 Team Folder C (Marketing campaigns)
│       ├── 📄 Project 4
│       └── 📋 Template Library
```

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Workspace | Team Folder (Team) |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Purpose** | Top-level organizational container | Specialized sub-group within workspace |
| **Creation** | Main organizational unit | Sub-unit for focused collaboration |
| **Members** | Separate member list per workspace | Separate member list per folder |
| **Permissions** | Independent access control | Independent access control |
| **Templates** | Workspace-wide templates | Folder-specific templates |
| **AI Agents** | Workspace-shared agents | Folder-specific agents |
| **Billing** | Associated with subscription | Covered under workspace plan |
| **Deletion** | Cannot delete if it has Home space | Can be deleted individually |

### When to Use Each

#### Choose a Workspace When You Need:
- **Complete Isolation**: Separate companies, clients, or major business units
- **Independent Billing**: Different subscription plans for different areas
- **Full Administrative Control**: Separate admins and billing managers
- **Distinct Branding**: Different visual identity and settings

#### Choose Team Folders When You Need:
- **Client Separation**: Keep client work isolated within shared workspace
- **Team Organization**: Group related projects without separate billing
- **Flexible Collaboration**: Mix internal and external teams
- **Cost Efficiency**: Share premium features across all folders

### Practical Examples

#### Scenario 1: Marketing Agency
```
🏢 Marketing Agency Workspace
├── 🏠 Home Space (Agency-wide resources)
├── 📁 Client A Projects
│   ├── Campaign planning
│   ├── Content creation

│   ├── Website development
│   └── Brand guidelines
└── 📁 Internal Operations
    ├── Team meetings
    ├── Process documentation

### Best Practices

#### Workspace Organization
