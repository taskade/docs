## 🚀 Bulk Upload & Organization

### **Bulk Upload Strategies**

#### **Method 1: Drag & Drop Collections**
```
📁 Knowledge Folder Structure:
├── 📂 Company Policies/
│   ├── employee_handbook.pdf
│   ├── code_of_conduct.docx
│   └── benefits_guide.xlsx
├── 📂 Product Documentation/
│   ├── user_manual_v2.pdf
│   ├── api_reference.md
│   └── troubleshooting_guide.pdf
