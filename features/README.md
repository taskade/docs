**Your Workspace: The Living DNA of Everything You Build**

Taskade isn't just another productivity platform â€” it's a living ecosystem where every project, agent, automation, and piece of knowledge connects to form the DNA of your digital workspace. Each component learns from the others, creating intelligence that grows stronger with every interaction.

## ðŸ§¬ The Four DNA Strands of Your Workspace

Just as DNA contains the genetic instructions for life, your Taskade workspace contains the digital instructions for everything you create â€” from simple projects to complex Genesis applications.

### **ðŸ§  Intelligence DNA: AI Agents**
*Your digital workforce that never sleeps*

Your AI agents are more than chatbots â€” they're **specialized team members** with unique knowledge, skills, and personalities. Each agent learns from your workspace, understands your business context, and can take actions on your behalf.

**What makes them unique:**
- **Custom Knowledge Training** - Upload documents, connect projects, add web sources
- **Specialized Skills** - Create agents for research, customer service, content creation, analysis
- **Multi-Model Intelligence** - Choose from GPT-4o, Claude, and advanced reasoning models
- **Tool Integration** - Agents can browse the web, analyze data, and connect to external services

**Real-world impact:**
- **Law firms** use legal research agents that know case law and firm precedents
- **Marketing agencies** deploy content creation agents trained on brand guidelines
- **Healthcare practices** run patient communication agents with HIPAA compliance

### **âš¡ Action DNA: Automations**
*Your business reflexes that respond instantly*

Automations are your workspace's nervous system â€” they detect events, process information, and take actions across 100+ integrated tools. They're the living connections that make your workspace reactive and intelligent.

**Core capabilities:**
- **Event-Driven Workflows** - React to new tasks, completed projects, form submissions
- **Cross-Platform Integration** - Connect Slack, Gmail, Google Sheets, HubSpot, and more

### **ðŸ“š Knowledge DNA: Projects & Data**
