# Quick Start Guide

**Start with Genesis. Your workspace becomes the foundation for unlimited apps.**

Every Taskade workspace begins with your **Home Subspace** — a living foundation where you'll build your first Genesis app in minutes. Skip the usual setup complexity and jump straight to creating something that works for your business.

## 🚀 **Create Your Home Subspace** (1 minute)

1. [**Sign up for free →**](https://taskade.com/signup)
2. **Name your workspace** - This becomes your **Home Subspace**, the foundation for all your apps
3. **Verify your email** - Check your inbox and click the confirmation link
4. **Complete your profile** - Add your name, role, and profile picture

**What you just created:** Your Home Subspace is now ready! It contains the living DNA (agents, automations, knowledge) that will power every Genesis app you build.

## 🧬 **Build Your First Genesis App** (5 minutes)

**This is where the magic happens.** Instead of managing tasks manually, let's build an app that solves a real business problem.

### **Step 1: Choose Your App Idea**

Pick something you actually need (examples):

* 📝 **Customer Feedback App** - Collect reviews with automatic manager alerts
* 📅 **Booking System** - Let customers schedule appointments online
* 📊 **Inventory Tracker** - Monitor stock levels with reorder alerts
* 🎯 **Lead Manager** - Capture and qualify sales leads automatically

### **Step 2: Open the Generator Interface**

1. Your workspace **IS** the Genesis interface - no separate tab needed
2. Look for the **prominent input field at the top** of your workspace
3. You'll see your existing projects/folders as **app tiles** below the input field

### **Step 3: Describe Your App**

Use this template - be specific:

```
I run a [BUSINESS TYPE] and need [USERS] to [ACTION]. 
They should be able to [SPECIFIC FEATURES].
When [TRIGGER EVENT], automatically [AUTOMATED ACTION].
```

**Example:**

```
I run a restaurant and need customers to submit feedback about their dining experience. They should be able to rate food quality, service speed, and overall satisfaction on a 1-5 scale, plus leave optional comments and upload photos. When someone gives us 3 stars or lower, automatically send a Slack message to our manager channel so we can follow up personally.
```

### **Step 4: Watch Genesis Build Your App**

1. **Type or paste your prompt** in the input field at the top of your workspace
2. **Press Enter or click Generate** - Genesis analyzes your request
3. **Your new app appears as a tile** below the generator in 30-60 seconds
4. Genesis creates: database structure, user interface, automations, and AI functionality

### **Step 5: Test Your Live App**

1. **Click on your new app tile** to enter the app workspace
2. **Click the "Preview" tab** in the top-right panel to see your live application
3. **Test as a real user** - submit data, navigate the interface, check mobile view
4. **Verify automations work** - check your connected services (Slack, email, etc.)
5. **Use the persistent AI Agent** in the left panel to make adjustments

**🎉 Congratulations!** You just created a complete business application in minutes.
