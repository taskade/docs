**New to Taskade?** Your workspace comes with a default **Home Subspace** where you can instantly build apps with [Genesis](genesis/README.md) or start with our [Quick Start Guide](getting-started/README.md). Each subspace becomes a complete app powered by your workspace's living DNA!
{% endhint %}

# Welcome to Taskade

**Start with Genesis. Build anything. Your workspace is the foundation.**

Every Taskade workspace begins with your **Home Subspace** — a living foundation where each subspace becomes a complete application. Whether you're building a customer feedback system, inventory tracker, or team dashboard, Genesis transforms your ideas into working apps in minutes, all powered by your workspace's interconnected intelligence.

## 🎯 What is Taskade?

**Where every workspace becomes a foundation for unlimited apps.**

Your Taskade workspace is your **Home Subspace** — the living foundation that powers everything you build. Each new subspace you create becomes a complete application, whether it's a customer portal, project tracker, or business dashboard. Genesis connects the dots between your workspace's intelligence and the apps you need.

**Here's how it works:**
- **🏠 Home Workspace** - Your default workspace with a generator input field at the top
- **📱 App = Complete Application** - Each app you create becomes a full business solution
- **🧬 Living DNA** - Your workspace's agents, automations, and projects power every app
- **🔗 Connected Intelligence** - Apps share intelligence and learn from each other

**The Genesis Interface:** Open any workspace and you'll see a prominent input field at the top. Just describe what you need in plain English, and Genesis builds a complete app in minutes. Your existing projects and folders appear as app tiles below the generator.

### **Every Workspace Contains:**
- **Generator Input** - The AI-powered field where you describe apps to build
- **🤖 AI Agents** - Persistent left panel assistant trained on your business
- **⚡ Smart Automations** - Connect to 100+ services automatically
