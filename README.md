# Welcome to Taskade

> Taskade Genesis — One Prompt. One App. Imagine it. Run it live. Powered by your Workspace — the backend + brain of your app.

**The productivity platform that actually gets how you work.**

Tired of juggling 10 different apps just to get things done? Taskade combines project management, AI assistance, and team collaboration in one place that doesn't suck. Whether you're organizing a side project, managing a remote team, or building the next big thing, Taskade adapts to *your* workflow instead of forcing you into theirs.

## 🎯 What is Taskade?

**Think Notion meets ChatGPT meets Zapier, but actually usable.**

Here's what you get:
- **📊 Projects That Make Sense** - No more fighting with rigid templates. Your data, your structure.
- **🤖 AI That Actually Helps** - Not just another chatbot. These agents learn your projects and can actually do stuff.
- **⚡ Automation That Works** - Connect your tools without becoming a YAML engineer.
- **🎨 Views That Don't Suck** - Switch between lists, kanban, calendar, or mind maps. Same data, different perspective.

**Real Talk:** Most productivity apps are built by people who've never actually used them daily. Taskade is different.
