**New to Taskade?** Your workspace comes with a default **Home Subspace** where you can instantly build apps with [Genesis](genesis/README.md) or start with our [Quick Start Guide](getting-started/README.md). Each subspace becomes a complete app powered by your workspace's living DNA!
{% endhint %}

# Welcome to Taskade

**Build Without Permission. Start with Genesis. Your workspace is the foundation.**

We believe the future of work isn't just humans using AI. It's humans and AI working as one.

- One prompt = one app.
- Your workspace = the backend.
- Your agents = the team.
- Your automations = the execution.

Software should be alive. And now, it is.

## What You Can Build in Minutes

| **App Type** | **Description** | **Build Time** |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Customer Feedback** | Reviews with instant alerts for issues | 3 minutes |
| **Appointment Booking** | Online scheduling with auto-confirmations | 4 minutes |
| **Inventory Tracker** | Stock monitoring with reorder alerts | 5 minutes |
| **Support Tickets** | Issue tracking with smart routing | 4 minutes |
| **Lead Capture** | Contact forms with CRM integration | 3 minutes |

**How it works:** Describe your app → Genesis builds everything → Your app is live with a shareable URL

## 🎯 What is Taskade?

**Where every workspace becomes a foundation for unlimited apps.**

Your Taskade workspace is your **Home Subspace** — the living foundation that powers everything you build. Each new subspace you create becomes a complete application, whether it's a customer portal, project tracker, or business dashboard. Genesis connects the dots between your workspace's intelligence and the apps you need.

**Here's how it works:**
- **🏠 Home Workspace** - Your default workspace with a generator input field at the top
- **📱 App = Complete Application** - Each app you create becomes a full business solution
- **🧬 Living DNA** - Your workspace's agents, automations, and projects power every app
- **🔗 Connected Intelligence** - Apps share intelligence and learn from each other

**The Genesis Interface:** Open any workspace and you'll see a prominent input field at the top. Just describe what you need in plain English, and Genesis builds a complete app in minutes. Your existing projects and folders appear as app tiles below the generator.

### **Every Workspace Contains:**
- **Generator Input** - The AI-powered field where you describe apps to build
- **🤖 AI Agents** - Persistent left panel assistant trained on your business
- **⚡ Smart Automations** - Connect to 100+ services automatically  
- **📊 App Tiles** - Your existing projects/folders, now enhanced as complete apps
