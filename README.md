# The HyperCard of the AI Era

Welcome to the Taskade API, a platform for building the next generation of intelligent applications. We are moving beyond productivity tools to offer something far more powerful: a complete system for generating, hosting, and scaling AI-powered web apps from a single prompt.

Inspired by the revolutionary simplicity of HyperCard, which empowered anyone to build software, Taskade is designed to democratize AI app creation. Our goal is to let you transform ideas into living, intelligent systems‚Äîwithout getting bogged down in complex infrastructure.

## The App Generator Vision

At the heart of Taskade is **TaskOS**, our AI App Generator. It works backward from your intent, transforming a simple goal‚Äîlike "create a customer feedback portal" or "build an automated sales tracker"‚Äîinto a complete, functional application.

Each generated app is a **Subspace**, a self-contained ecosystem with three core pillars:

1.  **üß† Knowledge (Memory):** Structured data using **Taskade Projects**. This is the memory and context that makes your app smart.
2.  **ü§ñ Intelligence (Logic):** **AI Agents** that can reason, plan, and execute tasks based on the knowledge they possess.
3.  **‚ö° Action (Execution):** **Automations**, forms, and API integrations that connect your app to the world and get work done.

### AI Kits: Ready-to-Deploy Workflows

Today, you can experience this vision through **[Taskade AI Kits](https://taskade.com/kits)**‚Äîpre-built bundles of projects, agents, automations, and templates that anyone can install and use in seconds.

Popular kits include:
- **AI Lead Generation Kit**: Complete lead management with capture forms and qualification agents
- **Customer Support Kit**: Automated ticket processing with AI triage and routing
- **Content Marketing Kit**: Research, generation, and publishing workflows
- **Real Estate News Kit**: Automated industry news monitoring and summarization

## What You Can Build

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, our API and upcoming SDK provide the building blocks to create:

*   **Internal Tools:** Build custom CRMs, project dashboards, and internal knowledge bases that are powered by agents who understand your team's data.
*   **Public-Facing Apps:** Launch branded landing pages, customer support portals, lead capture forms, and booking systems with AI assistants built-in.
*   **Agentic Workflows:** Design complex automations where AI agents collaborate to process information, make decisions, and interact with external services.

## Quick Start

Ready to build your first AI-powered application? Here's how to get started:

### 1. Get Your API Key
First, you'll need to authenticate with our API:
- [Get a Personal Access Token](start/personal-tokens.md)
- [Learn about Authentication](start/authentication.md)

### 2. Create Your First Subspace
```bash
# Create a new app container
curl -X POST https://www.taskade.com/api/v1/folders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "My First AI App", "color": "#4a90e2"}'
```

### 3. Build the Three Pillars

**Knowledge Layer:** Create a project to store your data
```bash
# Create a project (your app's memory)
curl -X POST https://www.taskade.com/api/v1/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name": "Customer Feedback", "folderId": "YOUR_SUBSPACE_ID"}'
```

**Intelligence Layer:** Deploy an AI agent
```bash
# Generate an agent for your app
curl -X POST https://www.taskade.com/api/v1/folders/YOUR_SUBSPACE_ID/agents/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Create a customer support agent that can analyze feedback and suggest improvements"}'
```

**Action Layer:** Set up automations (via the Taskade interface or upcoming automation API)

### 4. Deploy Your App
Your Subspace is now a living application! Share it with your team or make it public.

## Core Concepts

Based on Taskade's execution layer for AI collaboration:

- **Agents**: Autonomous teammates that can think, learn, and act. Agents read from project context, run tools, and trigger workflows.
- **Projects**: Real-time, tree-structured documents that serve as shared memory and execution hubs.
- **Automations**: Logic-based workflows with triggers (e.g. form submitted, time-based) and actions (e.g. create task, ask AI).
- **Generator**: One prompt creates everything you need: Project + Agent + Automation, all pre-wired to execute.
- **Kits**: Bundled agent workflows designed for sales, marketing, support, HR, and more.
- **Views**: List, Board, Table, Calendar, Mind Map, Org Chart, Gantt. Each view is powered by the same underlying tree structure.

## The Future: Open & Interoperable

We're building toward a future where entire AI applications can be packaged, shared, and version-controlled as `.tsk` files (Taskade System Kits). This will enable:

- **Version Control:** Store entire app architectures in Git
- **Sharing & Reusability:** Export and import complete systems
- **Interoperability:** Convert systems from other platforms
- **Headless Management:** Programmatic deployment via CLI/API

Today's [AI Kits](https://taskade.com/kits) are the foundation for this future standard.

## Architecture Overview

Taskade's platform is built on a robust, real-time architecture that includes:

- **Real-time Collaboration:** Operational transformation for conflict-free editing
- **Flexible Views:** 8 different project perspectives (List, Board, Calendar, Table, Mind Map, Org Chart, Action Sheet, Gantt)
- **Enterprise Security:** Role-based permissions and audit trails
- **Hybrid Search:** Keyword + semantic search with AI embeddings
- **100+ Integrations:** Connect with your existing tools and workflows

## Developer Resources
