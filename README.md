# Introduction

We're excited to introduce you to Version 1.0 of the [Taskade](https://www.taskade.com/) API. This is the starting point for integrating your applications and services with the Taskade platform.

**API Overview**

Built on RESTful principles, our API is designed to be simple yet powerful. You'll find resource-oriented URLs for intuitive navigation, form-encoded request bodies for efficient data transfer, and JSON-encoded responses for super easy parsing.



**Capabilities**

* [**Workspaces**](https://help.taskade.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042451654--Share-a-Workspace): Create a workspace or [folder](https://help.taskade.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043111854--Create-a-Folder-Subspace), or jump into one you've already set up.
* [**Projects**](https://help.taskade.com/hc/en-us/sections/360007284373--Projects): Start a new project, update it, or wrap it up.
