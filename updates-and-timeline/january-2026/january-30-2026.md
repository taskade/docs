# January 30, 2026

## What's New:

### EVE can now use Leaflet maps

You can now have maps that integrate with your apps!

Try out a prompt like:&#x20;

{% code overflow="wrap" fullWidth="false" %}
```
Make an app that shows on a map some good restaurants in the San Francisco Bay area.
```
{% endcode %}

<div data-full-width="false"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2026-02-04 at 15.48.14@2x.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>
