## What Is Taskade Genesis?

**Genesis is the HyperCard moment for the AI era.** 

In 1987, Apple launched HyperCard - a tool that let anyone build software by stacking cards. It was simple, playful, powerful. For a brief moment, the tools to build were in the hands of everyone. Then they disappeared.

For decades, software creation was locked behind IDEs, APIs, gatekeepers, and teams. Until now.

**Taskade Genesis is the HyperCard of the AI era.** One prompt. One app. A new system for a new generation.

Genesis is an AI app builder that creates complete business applications from a single prompt. You describe what you need, and Genesis builds a working app in minutes. Not a mockup or prototype, but fully functional software.

**We build for people like us:**
- The ones spinning 15 plates
- Founders with ideas but no engineering team
- Students, misfits, tinkerers
- The ones who never quite fit in but always knew they were meant to build something that does

**Unlike other app builders, Genesis gives you:**
- **Complete Applications** - Not just interfaces, but working business logic
- **Instant Deployment** - Your app is live and shareable immediately
- **AI-Powered Intelligence** - Apps that understand and process your data
- **Zero Technical Complexity** - Focus on business value, not code

## Step 1: Identify Your Business Problem (1 minute)

Start by thinking about something in your business that could work better. Common problems Genesis solves:

### **Customer Frustrations**

- _"Customers keep calling to book appointments when we're busy"_
- _"People submit support requests through random channels"_
- _"Clients don't know the status of their projects"_

### **Team Inefficiencies**

- _"We lose track of inventory and run out of popular items"_
- _"Following up with leads happens inconsistently"_
- _"Important tasks fall through the cracks"_

### **Data Chaos**

- _"Customer feedback is scattered across emails and reviews"_
- _"I can't see which products are performing well"_
- _"Team performance data is hard to track"_

**Your turn:** Write down the ONE business problem you want to solve first.

## üß¨ Understanding Your Workspace DNA

Before we build your app, it's important to understand what makes Genesis apps so powerful: **your workspace's living DNA**.

### Your Workspace = Your App's Brain

Every Genesis app is powered by your workspace's intelligence:

**üß† AI Agents** - Your digital team members with specialized knowledge
- Customer service agents that know your products
- Marketing agents that understand your brand voice  
- Research agents that can analyze data and trends

**üìä Projects** - Your business knowledge and data
- Customer information and interaction history
- Product catalogs and inventory data
- Team processes and standard operating procedures

**‚ö° Automations** - Your business reflexes
- Automatic follow-ups and notifications
- Data processing and categorization
- Integration with your existing tools

### Why This Matters for Your App

When you describe an app to Genesis, it doesn't build from scratch. Instead, it **awakens the intelligence already living in your workspace**:

- Your booking app knows your services because your workspace knows your services
- Your support app responds like your team because it's trained on your team's knowledge
- Your inventory app understands your products because your projects contain your product data

**This is what makes each Genesis app unique - it carries the DNA of your specific business.**

---

## üïê **Genesis Version History**

Every Genesis app includes complete version history! Track every change, collaborate with confidence, and never lose work again.

### **Automatic Change Tracking**
- **Every Edit Recorded**: Layout changes, content updates, configuration modifications - all automatically saved
- **Visual Timeline**: Browse your app's evolution with clear timestamps and change summaries  
- **Team Collaboration**: See exactly who made which changes and when
- **One-Click Restore**: Roll back to any previous version instantly

### **Professional Development Workflow**
Genesis version history uses enterprise-grade infrastructure (Pulsar message queuing) to ensure no changes are ever lost, even during high traffic periods. This creates a bulletproof audit trail perfect for:

- **Client Work**: Show clients exactly what was built and when
- **Team Projects**: Track contributions and resolve conflicts easily  
- **Experimentation**: Try bold changes knowing you can always revert
- **Compliance**: Maintain complete records for regulated industries

**Access Version History**: Click the version dropdown in any Genesis app to explore your complete development timeline.

## Step 2: Craft Your App Description (2 minutes)

Now turn your problem into a clear description using this proven formula:

### **The Magic Formula**

**WHO** uses it + **WHAT** they need to do + **WHAT** happens automatically

### **Template to Copy**

```
I run a [YOUR BUSINESS TYPE] and need [WHO WILL USE THIS] to [WHAT THEY NEED TO DO].

They should be able to [SPECIFIC ACTIONS THEY TAKE], and when they do, the system should [AUTOMATIC RESPONSES/ACTIONS].

I want to [HOW YOU'LL USE THE DATA] so I can [BUSINESS OUTCOME YOU WANT].
```

### **Real Examples**

**Restaurant Owner:**

```
I run a restaurant and need customers to submit feedback about their dining experience. They should rate food quality, service speed, and overall satisfaction on a 1-5 scale, plus leave optional comments and upload photos. When someone gives us 3 stars or lower, immediately alert our manager via Slack so we can follow up personally. I want to see all feedback in a dashboard so I can track trends and improve our service.
```

**Yoga Studio:**

```
I run a yoga studio and need clients to book classes online and pay in advance. They should see available class times, choose their preferred instructor, and pay a deposit. When someone books, send them a confirmation email with class details and add the appointment to our Google Calendar. I want to track which classes are most popular so I can schedule more of them.
```

**Consultant:**

```
I'm a business consultant and need potential clients to request proposals through my website. They should fill out their business challenges, budget range, and timeline, plus upload any relevant documents. When someone submits a request, send me an instant Slack notification and add their information to my CRM. I want to track which types of projects people request most so I can focus my marketing.
```

**Your turn:** Write your app description using the template above.
