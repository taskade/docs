## 📤 **Publish and Share Your Apps**

Share your Genesis creations with the world through publishing and cloning capabilities.

### **Publishing Apps**

Make your apps available to anyone with a link, creating public or private access points for your solutions.

**Publishing Benefits:**
- **Direct Access**: Users can interact with your app through a dedicated URL
- **No Installation Required**: Works immediately in any browser
- **Version Control**: Update your published app while maintaining the same link
- **Monetization Ready**: Foundation for future paywall and premium features

**Publishing Options:**
- **Public Apps**: Discoverable and accessible to anyone with the link
- **Private Apps**: Require specific permissions or passwords for access

### **App Visibility Settings**

Choose how people access your published app:

**Public Apps:**
- Anyone with the link can access and use your app
- No authentication required
- Ideal for marketing, demonstrations, or free tools

**Private Apps:**
- Require user authentication to access
- Control who can use your app
- Suitable for client portals or internal tools

### **Unpublishing Apps**

You can always unpublish your app if needed:

1. **Open your Genesis app** in your workspace
2. **Click the Publish dropdown** in the top toolbar
3. **Select "Unpublish"**
4. **Confirm the action**

**Note:** Unpublishing immediately removes public access, but the URL becomes inactive. Users who bookmarked the link will lose access.

### **Enabling Cloning**

Allow others to create complete copies of your app in their own workspaces.

**Cloning Features:**
- **One-Click Duplication**: Users can clone your entire app with a single click
- **Complete Fidelity**: All projects, agents, automations, and media files are copied
- **Independent Operation**: Cloned apps function completely independently
- **Customization Freedom**: Users can modify cloned apps without affecting the original

### **When to Use Templates vs. Cloning**

**Use Templates When:**
- You want to provide starting points for customization
- Users need to adapt the app significantly for their use case
- You're sharing incomplete or example workflows

**Use Cloning When:**
- Your app is a complete, working solution
- Users should have immediate functionality without setup
- You want to share proven, production-ready workflows

## 🍴 **Revolutionary App Forking**

The most powerful way to learn and build is by starting with working solutions. Genesis now lets you fork (copy) any community app with complete fidelity.

### **What is App Forking?**

Forking creates a complete, independent copy of a Genesis app in your workspace. Unlike simple templates, forking gives you:

- **Complete Workspace Clone**: All projects, agents, automations, and media files
- **Working Integrations**: Connections and workflows that function immediately  
- **Full Customization Rights**: Modify, rebrand, and extend however you want
- **Independent Evolution**: Your forked app develops separately from the original

### **One-Click Complete Duplication**

When you fork a Genesis app, you get:

| What Gets Copied | Details |
|------------------|---------|
| **🎨 App Interface** | Complete layout, styling, and user experience |
| **📊 Projects & Data** | All project structures with example data |
| **🤖 AI Agents** | Trained agents with their knowledge and personalities |
| **⚡ Automations** | Working workflows and integrations |
| **📁 Media Files** | Images, documents, and assets |
| **🔧 Configuration** | Settings, permissions, and customizations |

### **Professional Use Cases**

**For Agencies:**
- Fork client portal templates and customize for each client
- Start with proven solutions instead of building from scratch
- Maintain consistent quality across client projects

**For Entrepreneurs:**
- Copy successful business models and adapt to your market
- Learn from working examples of complex workflows
- Accelerate time-to-market with proven foundations

**For Teams:**
- Share internal tools across departments
- Standardize processes with working templates
- Enable non-technical team members to deploy solutions
