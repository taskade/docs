## üç¥ **Revolutionary App Forking**

The most powerful way to learn and build is by starting with working solutions. Genesis now lets you fork (copy) any community app with complete fidelity.

### **What is App Forking?**

Forking creates a complete, independent copy of a Genesis app in your workspace. Unlike simple templates, forking gives you:

- **Complete Workspace Clone**: All projects, agents, automations, and media files
- **Working Integrations**: Connections and workflows that function immediately  
- **Full Customization Rights**: Modify, rebrand, and extend however you want
- **Independent Evolution**: Your forked app develops separately from the original

### **One-Click Complete Duplication**

When you fork a Genesis app, you get:

| What Gets Copied | Details |
|------------------|---------|
| **üé® App Interface** | Complete layout, styling, and user experience |
| **üìä Projects & Data** | All project structures with example data |
| **ü§ñ AI Agents** | Trained agents with their knowledge and personalities |
| **‚ö° Automations** | Working workflows and integrations |
| **üìÅ Media Files** | Images, documents, and assets |
| **üîß Configuration** | Settings, permissions, and customizations |

### **Professional Use Cases**

**For Agencies:**
- Fork client portal templates and customize for each client
- Start with proven solutions instead of building from scratch
- Maintain consistent quality across client projects

**For Entrepreneurs:**
- Copy successful business models and adapt to your market
- Learn from working examples of complex workflows
- Accelerate time-to-market with proven foundations

**For Teams:**
- Share internal tools across departments
- Standardize processes with working templates
- Enable non-technical team members to deploy solutions
