## 🍽️ Restaurant & Food Service

### Customer Feedback Collection System

**Business Challenge:** *"Customers leave reviews on third-party sites, but we don't see them quickly enough to address problems or thank happy customers."*

**Genesis Prompt:**
```
I run a restaurant and need customers to submit feedback about their dining experience. They should rate food quality (1-5), service speed (1-5), and overall satisfaction (1-5), plus leave optional comments and upload photos of their food if they want to. When someone gives us 3 stars or lower on any category, immediately send a Slack alert to our manager with the customer's feedback so we can follow up personally within 30 minutes. Also send a thank you email to every customer who submits feedback, and create a weekly summary report of all ratings and comments for our team meetings.
```

**What Genesis Built:**
- **Smart Feedback Form** - Easy rating system with photo uploads
- **Instant Manager Alerts** - Slack notifications for low ratings (≤3 stars)
- **Customer Thank You System** - Automated personalized emails
- **Performance Dashboard** - Weekly analytics and trend tracking
- **Response Management** - Track follow-up actions taken

**Real Results:**
- **40% increase** in customer satisfaction scores
- **Response time to complaints:** 30 minutes (down from 3-5 days)
- **Google Reviews improvement:** 3.8 to 4.6 stars in 8 weeks
- **Time saved:** 5 hours/week on feedback management

### Online Reservation System

**Genesis Prompt:**
```
I own a fine dining restaurant and need customers to make reservations online for dinner service. They should select their preferred date, time (6:00-10:00 PM in 30-minute slots), party size (2-8 people), and any special dietary requirements or occasion notes. When someone makes a reservation, automatically send them a confirmation email with our address and parking information, add the reservation to our Google Calendar, and notify our host staff via Slack. If someone tries to book a time that's already full, suggest the next available slot within 1 hour of their requested time.
```

**Results:**
- **60% reduction** in phone reservation calls
- **Zero double-bookings** since implementation
- **15% increase** in advance reservations
- **Customer satisfaction:** 4.9/5 for booking experience

## 🧘 Health & Wellness

### Yoga Studio Class Booking

**Genesis Prompt:**
```
I run a yoga studio with 4 instructors and need clients to book classes online and pay deposits in advance. Clients should see available classes with instructor names, class types (Beginner Hatha, Vinyasa Flow, Power Yoga), and remaining spots (max 15 per class). When they book, charge a $10 deposit via Stripe, send them a confirmation email with class details and what to bring, and add the class to their Google Calendar with our studio address. If a class gets canceled, automatically refund deposits and send update emails to all registered participants.
```

**Results:**
- **2 hours daily** saved on booking management
- **95% advance payment rate** (up from 60%)
- **25% increase** in class attendance
- **Cancellation management:** Fully automated

### Personal Training Client Portal

**Genesis Prompt:**
```
I'm a personal trainer and need clients to schedule sessions, track their progress, and submit weekly check-ins. Clients should be able to book available 1-hour slots, upload progress photos, record their weight and measurements, and rate their energy levels (1-10). When someone books a session, add it to both our calendars and send workout prep instructions. When they submit weekly check-ins, analyze their progress and send me a summary so I can prepare personalized feedback for their next session.
```

**Results:**
- **Client retention:** 85% (up from 65%)
- **Session no-shows:** Reduced by 70%
- **Progress tracking:** 100% client participation
- **Revenue per client:** 30% increase through better engagement

## 🛍️ Retail & E-commerce

### Inventory Management & Reorder System

**Genesis Prompt:**
```
I run a boutique clothing store and need to track inventory levels and automate reordering. For each product, track current stock, minimum threshold (varies by item), supplier information, and lead times. When any item drops below its minimum threshold, automatically email the supplier with a reorder request including our standard order quantities, send me a Slack notification, and create a purchase order in our system. Also generate a weekly low-stock report showing trends and seasonal patterns so I can adjust minimum levels.
```

**Results:**
- **Zero stockouts** in 6 months
- **Inventory carrying costs:** Reduced 25%
- **Supplier relationships:** Improved with consistent ordering
- **Time saved:** 10 hours/week on inventory management

### Customer Loyalty Program

**Genesis Prompt:**
```
I need a customer loyalty system for my coffee shop where customers earn points for purchases and can redeem rewards. Customers should be able to check their points balance, see available rewards (free coffee at 100 points, pastry at 50 points), and redeem rewards via QR code. When someone makes a purchase, they earn 10 points per dollar spent, and when they reach reward milestones, send them a congratulations email with their reward code. Also track popular rewards and customer spending patterns for marketing insights.
```

**Results:**
- **Customer visit frequency:** 40% increase
- **Average transaction:** 25% higher
- **Customer retention:** 60% improvement
- **Data insights:** Drive targeted promotions

## 🏢 Professional Services

### Client Proposal Request System

**Genesis Prompt:**
```
I'm a marketing consultant and need potential clients to request proposals through my website. They should describe their business challenges, current marketing activities, desired outcomes, budget range ($5K-$50K+), and project timeline. They can upload relevant documents like brand guidelines or current marketing materials. When someone submits a request, send me an instant Slack notification with their key details, add their information to my HubSpot CRM, and send them an automated response with next steps and my calendar link for a discovery call.
```

**Results:**
- **Lead quality:** 60% improvement (better-qualified prospects)
- **Response time:** From hours to minutes
- **Conversion rate:** 35% increase
- **Proposal accuracy:** Better scoping from detailed requests

## 🎯 Writing Your Own Prompts

### The Proven Formula

Use this structure for any business application:

```
I [YOUR ROLE] and need [WHO WILL USE THIS] to [MAIN ACTION THEY TAKE].

They should be able to [SPECIFIC FEATURES/FIELDS], and when they [TRIGGER ACTION], the system should [AUTOMATIC RESPONSES].

I want to [HOW YOU'LL USE THE DATA] so I can [BUSINESS OUTCOME].

[OPTIONAL: Any special requirements, integrations, or compliance needs]
```

### Success Tips

1. **Be Specific About Users** - "Customers," "employees," "vendors" - who exactly?
2. **Define Clear Actions** - What should happen and when?
3. **Specify Integrations** - Email, Slack, calendar, payment systems
4. **Include Success Metrics** - How will you measure if this works?
5. **Think About Mobile** - Will users access this on phones?

### Common Prompt Mistakes

❌ **Too Vague:** "I need a booking system"  
✅ **Perfect:** "I need customers to book 60-minute massage appointments with specific therapists, pay deposits, and get calendar reminders"

❌ **No Automation:** "Collect customer feedback"  
✅ **Perfect:** "Collect feedback and send Slack alerts for ratings below 4 stars"

❌ **Missing Context:** "Track inventory"  
✅ **Perfect:** "Track inventory for a clothing store with seasonal items and automatic supplier reordering"
