# Quick Access: Share Genesis App Ideas

**Share your genius app ideas instantly - no typing required!**

Genesis now lets you share app ideas through special links that automatically fill in the app description. Send someone a link, and they can build your exact idea with one click.

---

## How It Works

Instead of explaining your app idea over email or chat, you can now share a direct link that opens Genesis with your idea already typed in.

### **The Magic Link Format**

```
https://taskade.com/create?input=YOUR_APP_IDEA
```

When someone clicks your link, Genesis opens with:

- ✅ Your app description already filled in
- ✅ Ready to generate immediately
- ✅ No typing or copy-pasting needed

---

## Real Examples You Can Try

Click any of these links to see how it works:

### **Customer Service Apps**

**Help Desk Ticket System:**

```
/create?input=Create a customer support ticket system where customers can submit problems, attach screenshots, and track resolution status. Send email updates when tickets are assigned or resolved.
```

**Feedback Collection:**

```
/create?input=Build a customer feedback form with star ratings, comment sections, and automatic thank you emails. Alert the team when someone gives less than 3 stars.
```

### **Business Management Apps**

## How to Create Your Own Sharing Links

### **Step 1: Write Your App Idea**

Describe your app like you're talking to a colleague:

```
I need customers to book demo calls with our sales team.
They should pick a time slot, enter their company info,
and automatically get calendar invites.
```

### **Step 2: Add It to the Link**

Take your description and add it after `?input=`:

```
/create?input=I need customers to book demo calls with our sales team. They should pick a time slot, enter their company info, and automatically get calendar invites.
```

### **Step 3: Handle Special Characters**

If your description has quotes, spaces, or special characters, you'll need to "URL encode" them. Most browsers do this automatically when you copy from the address bar.

**Common Replacements:**

- Spaces become `%20`
- Quotes become `%22`
- & becomes `%26`

## Smart Use Cases

### **For Teams**

**Share with Colleagues:**

```
"Hey, I built this link for the client portal idea we discussed:
/create?input=Create a client portal where customers can view project status, upload files, and message our team directly."
```

**Onboard New Team Members:**

```
"Try building this sample app to learn Genesis:
/create?input=Build a simple expense tracker where employees submit receipts, categorize expenses, and managers can approve or reject them."
```

### **For Clients & Customers**

**Consultant to Client:**

```
"Here's exactly what I'm proposing to build for your business:
/create?input=Create a lead capture form for real estate agents with property preferences, budget range, and automatic follow-up email sequences."
```

**Template Sharing:**

```
"Other restaurants love this app - click to build your own version:
/create?input=Build a table reservation system with available time slots, party size selection, and SMS confirmations to guests."
```

### **For Documentation & Training**

**Tutorial Examples:**

```
"Follow along with this example:
/create?input=Create a simple contact form with name, email, message fields, and email notifications to the admin."
```

## Pro Tips

### **Make Better Sharing Links**

**✅ Be Specific:**

```
Good: "Create a restaurant reservation system with table availability, guest preferences, and confirmation emails"
```

**❌ Stay Too General:**

```
Not helpful: "Build a booking app"
```

**✅ Include Automation:**

```
Good: "Build a contact form that sends submissions to Slack and adds leads to our CRM"
```

**❌ Forget the Magic:**

```
Missing opportunity: "Build a contact form"
```

### **Test Your Links**

Before sharing, click your own link to make sure:

- The description appears correctly
- Special characters display properly
- The app idea is clear and actionable

### **Combine with Workspaces**

You can also pre-select which workspace to build in:

```
/create?spaceId=your-workspace-id&input=Your app description here
```

This is perfect for team environments where you want apps built in specific workspaces.

## Why This Matters

### **Faster Collaboration**

Instead of this conversation:

> "Can you build an app for customer feedback?"
> "What kind of feedback?"
> "Like ratings and comments"
> "What happens with the data?"
> "Send it to our team"
> "Which team?"
> ...

You get this:

> "Build this: [link with complete description]"
> "Done!"

### **Consistent Results**

When you share exact descriptions, everyone builds the same thing. No more miscommunication about requirements.

### **Instant Demos**

Perfect for:

- Client presentations
- Team brainstorming
- Training sessions
- Documentation examples

---

## Troubleshooting

### **Link Doesn't Work?**

**Check the URL format:**

- Must include `?input=` before your description
- Make sure there are no extra spaces or characters

**Special characters not showing?**

- Some characters need URL encoding
- Copy the link from your browser's address bar after testing

**Description gets cut off?**

- Very long descriptions might hit URL length limits
- Try shortening while keeping the key details

### **Want to Edit After Clicking?**

No problem! When you click a shared link:

1. Genesis opens with the description pre-filled
2. You can edit the text before generating
3. Add your own touches or modifications
4. Generate your customized version
