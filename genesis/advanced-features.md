# Advanced Features

Once you've mastered the basics of Genesis, these advanced features will help you build more sophisticated and powerful applications. These features leverage the deep integration between Taskade's core pillars and the TAA (Taskade AI Assistant) Unified System that powers Genesis.

## Understanding the TAA Unified System

The **TAA Unified System** is the intelligent orchestration layer that makes Genesis possible. It coordinates between:

- **Project Management Tools** - Create and manage data structures
- **AI Agent Tools** - Deploy and train intelligent assistants  
- **Automation Tools** - Build complex workflows and integrations
- **Media Tools** - Process and organize knowledge sources
- **Navigation Tools** - Connect everything into a cohesive user experience

This unified approach means your Genesis apps have access to enterprise-grade capabilities that would normally require months of development.

## Working with Data

Your Genesis app automatically creates a structured database, but you can customize how data is organized and used.

### Custom Data Structures

**Create organized data categories:**
```
"Create separate sections for different types of feedback: food quality, service experience, and facility cleanliness. Each section should have its own rating scale and specific questions."
```

**Add dropdown menus for consistency:**
```
"Add a dropdown for customers to select which location they visited: Downtown, Mall, or Airport location."
```

**Include reference fields:**
```
"Include a field to capture the server's name so we can recognize great service and provide targeted feedback to staff."
```

### Data Relationships

**Link related information:**
```
"When a customer books an appointment, automatically pull in their previous service history and preferences from our customer database."
```

**Create parent-child relationships:**
```
"Each project should have multiple tasks underneath it, and each task can have subtasks with individual deadlines and assignees."
```

## AI Agent Customization

Every Genesis app includes custom AI agents powered by advanced language models (GPT-4.1, Claude-4, o3-mini, o4-mini) that can be trained for your specific business needs.

### AI Model Selection for Your Agents

Genesis automatically selects the best AI model for your use case, but you can specify preferences:

| **Model** | **Best For** | **Speed** | **Capabilities** |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|------------------|
| **GPT-4.1** | Complex reasoning, strategic planning | Medium | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Advanced problem-solving |
| **Claude-4 Sonnet** | Writing, analysis, creative tasks | Fast | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent communication |
| **o4-mini** | Balanced performance, coding tasks | Fast | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ Reliable and efficient |
| **o3-mini** | Quick responses, simple tasks | Very Fast | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ Efficient for basic needs |

### Comprehensive Agent Training

```
"Train the agent on our customer feedback project so it learns from every new review and can identify patterns in real-time."
```

**2. Static Knowledge (Uploaded Files):**
```
"Upload our employee handbook, service menu with prices, and company policies so the agent always gives accurate information about our business."
```

**3. Web Knowledge (Current Information):**
```
"Connect the agent to our industry news websites and competitor analysis so it stays current with market trends and can provide informed recommendations."
```

### Advanced Agent Capabilities

**Multi-Modal Understanding:**
```
"Train the agent to analyze customer photos along with their feedback to identify specific issues like food presentation problems or facility maintenance needs."
```

```
"Have the agent analyze patterns across both customer feedback and sales data to identify which services generate the most satisfaction and revenue."
```

**Predictive Analytics:**
```
"Train the agent to predict busy periods based on historical booking data and suggest optimal staffing levels and inventory orders."
```

### Custom Agent Commands

Create specialized commands for specific business tasks:

**Customer Service Commands:**
```
"/analyze-feedback" - Automatically categorize and prioritize customer feedback

```

**Retail/E-commerce:**
```
"Train the agent to be enthusiastic and helpful, like a knowledgeable sales associate. Focus on understanding customer needs, making relevant product suggestions, and creating a positive shopping experience."
```

**Professional Services:**
```

```

## Advanced Automations

Connect your app to your existing business tools and create sophisticated workflows.

### Multi-Step Workflows

**Complex approval processes:**
```
"When someone submits an expense report over $500, send it to their direct manager for approval. If approved, forward to finance for final review. If rejected at any stage, notify the employee with specific feedback."
```

**Customer journey automation:**
```
"When we get 5-star feedback, automatically post it to our Google My Business page, add the customer to our VIP newsletter list, and send them a discount code for their next visit."
```

### Conditional Logic

3. **Get user feedback** before adding more complexity
4. **Document your workflows** so team members understand how everything works

### Maintain User Focus

1. **Every advanced feature should solve a real problem** for your users
2. **Don't add complexity just because you can** - keep the user experience simple
3. **Test with actual users** to ensure advanced features improve rather than complicate their experience

### Plan for Maintenance

1. **Document your automations and integrations** so others can understand and maintain them
2. **Test regularly** to ensure external integrations continue working
3. **Have backup plans** for critical workflows in case integrations fail
4. **Train your team** on how to use and troubleshoot advanced features
