## Organizing Your Data Like a Pro

Genesis automatically creates smart storage for your information, but you can make it even better organized for your specific needs.

### Making Data Work for Your Business

**Organize information into clear categories:**
```
"I want separate sections for different feedback types: how was the food, how was the service, and how was the restaurant cleanliness. Give each section its own 1-5 star rating and room for comments."
```

**Use dropdowns to keep things consistent:**
```
"Add a dropdown menu so customers can pick which location they visited: our Downtown spot, Mall location, or Airport branch."
```

**Track important details:**
```
"Add a field for the server's name so we can recognize when someone gives great service and share the feedback with our team."
```

### Data Relationships

**Link related information:**
```
"When a customer books an appointment, automatically pull in their previous service history and preferences from our customer database."
```

**Create parent-child relationships:**
```
"Each project should have multiple tasks underneath it, and each task can have subtasks with individual deadlines and assignees."
```

## Performance Optimization

## 🚀 **Power User Prompts & Use Cases**

Ready to unlock Genesis's full potential? Here are advanced prompts and real-world scenarios that show how Taskade powers your business success.

### **🎯 Smart Business Prompts**

**Customer Experience Apps:**
```
"Create a restaurant feedback system where customers rate food quality, service speed, and cleanliness on a 1-5 scale. When someone gives a rating below 3, immediately send me a Slack alert with their feedback and contact info so I can follow up personally within 30 minutes."
```

**Team Productivity Apps:**
```
"Build a project handoff system where when someone marks a task as 'Ready for Review', it automatically assigns it to the next person, sends them a notification with all the context, and creates a deadline 2 days from now. If they don't respond in 24 hours, escalate to the team lead."
```

**Sales & Lead Management:**
```
"Make a lead qualification app where prospects fill out their business size, budget range, and timeline. Automatically score them as Hot (budget >$10K, timeline <30 days), Warm, or Cold, then route Hot leads to my CRM and send me an instant notification with their details."
```

### **🔗 Connecting the Dots: How Taskade Powers You**

**Your Workspace = Your Business Brain:**
Every Genesis app you build learns from your workspace's existing knowledge. Your customer data, team processes, and business intelligence all work together automatically.

**Example: Restaurant Chain Owner**
- **Morning**: Check your feedback app (powered by customer data from all locations)
- **Afternoon**: Your inventory app (connected to the same customer preferences) suggests menu adjustments
- **Evening**: Your staff scheduling app (knowing busy periods from feedback data) optimizes tomorrow's shifts

**The Magic:** All three apps share the same business intelligence, making each one smarter.

### **🎨 Creative Workflow Prompts**

**Content Production Pipeline:**
```
"Create a video production tracker where I can upload scripts, assign roles (writer, editor, thumbnail designer), set deadlines, and track progress. When a video is marked 'Complete', automatically post it to our content calendar and notify the social media team."
```

**Brand Asset Management:**
```
"Build a brand library where team members can upload logos, photos, and graphics with tags like 'summer campaign' or 'product shots'. Make it searchable so anyone can quickly find the right assets, and track who downloaded what for usage reporting."
```

### **📊 Data-Driven Decision Making**

**Business Intelligence Prompts:**
```
"Create a dashboard that shows me this week's customer feedback scores, compares them to last month, identifies trending complaints, and suggests which locations need attention. Update it automatically every morning at 9 AM."
```

**Performance Tracking:**
```
"Build a team productivity app that tracks project completion rates, identifies bottlenecks, and shows me which team members might need support. Send me a weekly summary every Friday with actionable insights."
```

### **⚡ Automation That Actually Helps**

**Smart Follow-ups:**
- When a customer books a service, automatically send them preparation instructions 24 hours before
