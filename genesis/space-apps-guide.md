## What Are Space Apps?

Space Apps are Genesis's way of turning your ideas into real, professional websites. Instead of building internal tools for your team, Space Apps create polished websites that your customers can visit and useâ€”complete with their own web address!

### **Space Apps vs. Project-Based Apps**

| Feature | Space Apps | Project-Based Apps |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **What You Get** | Real websites your customers visit | Internal team workspaces |
| **Where It Lives** | Your own web address (like yoursite.com) | Inside your Taskade workspace |
| **Who Uses It** | Your customers and the public | Your team members |
| **How It Looks** | Complete control over design and branding | Uses Taskade's standard layouts |
| **What's Inside** | Modern website technology | Taskade's project tools |
| **Speed** | Lightning-fast loading worldwide | Fast within Taskade |
| **Tech Stuff** | All the code if you want to see it | No code access needed |

## ðŸŽ“ Best Practices for Space Apps

### Prompt Engineering

Write effective prompts for better results:

**Include these elements:**
1. **Business context**: What type of business/industry
2. **Target users**: Who will use the application
3. **Core functionality**: What users need to accomplish
4. **Visual preferences**: Brand colors, style, layout
5. **Device requirements**: Mobile, tablet, desktop focus

**Example of a well-structured prompt:**
```
I run a dental practice and need patients to book appointments online. 
They should see available time slots, select services (cleaning, checkup, 
cosmetic), and provide insurance information. The app should send 
confirmation emails and add appointments to our practice calendar. 
Use a clean, professional design with our brand colors (blue and white) 
and ensure it works perfectly on mobile devices since most patients 
will book from their phones.
```

### Performance Guidelines

Optimize your Space Apps for speed:

- **Image optimization**: Use WebP format for faster loading
- **Lazy loading**: Load content as users scroll
- **Code splitting**: Split large features into separate bundles
- **Caching strategies**: Leverage browser and CDN caching
- **Mobile-first**: Design for mobile, enhance for desktop

### Accessibility Standards

Ensure your apps are accessible to all users:

- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading structure and landmarks
- **Keyboard navigation**: All interactive elements accessible via keyboard
- **Screen reader support**: ARIA labels and descriptions
- **Color contrast**: Meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Focus management**: Clear focus indicators throughout
