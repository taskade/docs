# Frequently Asked Questions

## Overview

### What is Taskade Genesis?

Genesis is like having a personal app developer who works instantly. You describe a business problem in plain English (like "I need customers to book appointments online"), and Genesis builds a complete working app for you - no coding, no setup, no technical knowledge required.

### How is this different from other app builders?

Genesis gives you the complete backend: Databases, Automation Workflows, AI Agents, and Integrations. Other tools just make interfaces.

**Genesis provides:**
- **Smart database** that stores your data automatically
- **AI assistant** that learns your business and helps customers
- **Automatic actions** that connect to your email, Slack, payment systems, etc.
- **Real functionality** - not just mockups or prototypes
- **Complete backend infrastructure** - hosting, security, and scaling handled automatically

**Other app builders require:**
- Manual database setup and configuration
- Separate hosting and deployment
- Third-party integrations you have to configure yourself
- Technical knowledge for backend functionality

Genesis handles all the technical complexity so you can focus on your business.

### What kinds of apps can I build?

**Popular app types:**
- **Customer portals** for service requests and communication
- **Team dashboards** for monitoring KPIs and workflows
- **Booking systems** for appointments and events
- **Inventory trackers** with smart alerts and reporting
- **Feedback forms** with automated response workflows
- **Project trackers** for task and deadline management
- **Workflow automation** for repetitive business processes
- **Custom tools** for industry-specific needs

### Do I need to know how to code?

No. Genesis understands business language and handles all technical implementation automatically. You focus on describing your business needs, and Genesis handles the programming.

## Building Your App

### How long does it take to build an app?

**Typical timeframes:**
- **Simple apps:** 2-5 minutes (basic forms, simple workflows)
- **Complex business applications:** 10-15 minutes including customization and testing
- **Enterprise-level apps:** 20-30 minutes with advanced features and integrations

### Can I change my app after Genesis builds it?

Yes! Describe any changes you want and Genesis implements them immediately. Your app evolves with your business needs - just tell Genesis what you want to adjust.

### What if the first version isn't quite right?

You have several options:
- **Make specific requests** for changes ("make the button bigger")
- **Provide more context** about what's not working
- **Start fresh** with a more detailed description if major changes are needed

Genesis gets better results with clearer requirements, so don't hesitate to be more specific about what you need.

### Can I see examples of what other people have built?

Yes! Check out:
- **[Examples and templates](examples-and-templates.md)** in this documentation
- **Community showcase** in the Taskade forums
- **Video tutorials** on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/taskade)

## Sharing and Access

### How do I test my app before sharing it?

Use the **Preview feature** to interact with your app exactly as users will:
1. Click the "Preview" tab in your app
2. Test all functionality like a real user
3. Submit test data to ensure workflows work
4. Check that notifications and integrations trigger properly
5. Test on mobile devices if users will access via phone

### How do I publish my app?

Every app gets an **individual URL immediately**:
1. Click "Open" to view your live app
2. Copy the URL from your browser address bar
3. Share this link anywhere: email, social media, your website
4. No downloads or installations required for users

### Can I use my own domain name?

**Coming soon!** You'll be able to use your own branded URL (like `app.yourcompany.com`) instead of the default Genesis link, giving your apps a more professional appearance that matches your brand.

### How do users access my app?

**Simple access:**
- Send them the link - no downloads or installations required
- Apps work in any web browser on desktop, tablet, or mobile phone
- Users can bookmark the link for easy return access

### Can I control who uses my app?

Yes! Tell Genesis what access you want and it sets it up:
- **"Make this app private with password protection"**
- **"Only allow users with company email addresses"**
- **"Require login for staff but allow public access for customers"**

If you set a password, make sure to share it along with the app link.

## Best Practices

### How do I write better prompts?

**Follow the formula:** Industry + Users + Problem + Solution + Outcome

**Be specific about:**
- **Your industry** and business type
- **Who will use** the app and how
- **What problem** you're solving
- **What should happen** when users complete actions

See our [Best Practices guide](best-practices.md) for detailed examples.

### Should I build one big app or several smaller ones?

**Generally, smaller focused apps work better:**
- **Easier to build** and test thoroughly
- **Simpler for users** to understand and use
- **Faster performance** and loading times
- **Easier to maintain** and update

**Consider one large app when:**
- Users need to access multiple functions in one session
- Data needs to be shared between different functions
- You want a unified dashboard for everything

### How often should I update my app?

**Regular maintenance schedule:**
- **Weekly:** Check that integrations are working
- **Monthly:** Review user feedback and usage data
- **Quarterly:** Consider new features or improvements
- **As needed:** Fix bugs or address user complaints immediately
