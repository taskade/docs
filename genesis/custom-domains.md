## üåê What Are Custom Domains?

Custom domains let your Genesis apps live at your own web address instead of a random Taskade link that screams "I used a free tool."

### Before Custom Domains (Looks Amateurish)
```
https://random-gibberish-a7b2.taskade.app
https://purple-elephant-xyz.taskade.com
```

### With Custom Domains (Looks Professional)
```
https://app.yourcompany.com
https://portal.clientname.com
https://booking.restaurantname.com
```

This simple change makes customers think you hired a team of developers when really you just described what you wanted in plain English!

## üõ† Advanced Domain Configuration

### Multiple Subdomains

You can configure multiple subdomains for different purposes:

```
app.yourcompany.com      ‚Üí Main application hub
portal.yourcompany.com   ‚Üí Customer portal
admin.yourcompany.com    ‚Üí Administrative interface
api.yourcompany.com      ‚Üí API endpoints
```

Each subdomain requires its own CNAME record and Taskade configuration.

### Domain Path Structure

Custom domains support path-based app organization:

```
app.yourcompany.com/feedback    ‚Üí Feedback system
app.yourcompany.com/booking     ‚Üí Booking system  
app.yourcompany.com/dashboard   ‚Üí Analytics dashboard
```

### Wildcard Subdomains

For advanced users, wildcard CNAME records enable dynamic subdomains:

```
DNS: *.yourcompany.com ‚Üí custom-domains.taskade.com

Results in:
anything.yourcompany.com works automatically
client1.yourcompany.com
client2.yourcompany.com
project-x.yourcompany.com
```

```

**Advanced Customization:**

‚ùå Default success messages
‚úÖ "Thank you! Our team will review your submission."
```

### Email Integration

Configure emails from your domain:
