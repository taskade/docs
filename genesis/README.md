## How Genesis Works: The Magic Behind the Scenes

When you describe your app to Genesis, it automatically creates four essential components that work together seamlessly:

### **1. Smart Database (Projects)**
- Stores all your business data automatically
- Creates custom fields for your specific needs
- Handles customer info, orders, feedback, inventory - whatever you need
- **Example:** Customer feedback stored with ratings, comments, photos, and follow-up status

### **2. AI Assistant (Agents)**  
- Learns your business from uploaded documents and data patterns
- Answers customer questions automatically
- Makes smart decisions based on your business rules
- **Example:** Booking assistant that knows your services, availability, and policies

### **3. Automatic Actions (Automations)**
- Connects your app to email, Slack, payment systems, and 100+ tools
- Triggers actions when events happen (new booking, low rating, etc.)
- Handles complex multi-step workflows automatically
- **Example:** When someone books an appointment → sends confirmation → adds to calendar → charges payment

### **4. File & Knowledge Management (Media)**
- Handles document uploads and photo submissions
- Trains your AI assistant on business documents and policies  
- Stores and organizes files automatically
- **Example:** Upload your menu so the AI can answer food questions accurately

**Who will use it:**
```
"Our customers need to..."
"My team should be able to..."
"Clients want to..."
```

**What they need to do:**
```
"...book appointments and pay online"
"...submit feedback with photos"
"...track their project status"
```

**What happens next:**
```
"...get confirmation emails and calendar invites"
"...trigger manager alerts for low ratings"
"...receive automatic progress updates"
```

## Example: Building a Restaurant Feedback App

Let's walk through a real example:

### **The Problem**
*"Customers leave reviews on Google and Yelp, but we don't see them quickly enough to respond to problems. We need a way to collect feedback directly and get immediate alerts for issues."*

### **The Genesis Prompt**
```
I run a restaurant and need customers to submit feedback about their dining experience. They should rate food quality, service speed, and overall satisfaction on a 1-5 scale, plus leave optional comments and upload photos if they want. When someone gives us 3 stars or lower, immediately alert our manager via Slack so we can follow up personally. All feedback should be stored in a dashboard where we can see trends and respond to individual reviews.
```
