# Taskade Genesis

**Taskade Genesis** is your no-code creation layer — generate intelligent apps from a single prompt. Every Genesis app is backed by structured Projects, Agents, and Automations that work together as a cohesive system. **Genesis is built on top of [TaskOS](../taskos/introduction.md), the same engine developers can access programmatically, so anything you create here can later be extended in code.**

## What is Genesis?

Genesis is Taskade's **AI App Generator** that transforms natural language descriptions into fully functional applications. It's designed for non-technical users who want to create powerful AI-powered tools without writing code.

### The Magic of One-Prompt Creation

Simply describe what you want to build:

- *"Create a customer feedback portal that analyzes sentiment and routes issues to the right team"*
- *"Build a content calendar that generates blog ideas and tracks publication status"*
- *"Make a lead qualification system that scores prospects and schedules follow-ups"*

Genesis understands your intent and generates:
- **📊 Structured Projects** (your app's data layer)
- **🤖 Intelligent Agents** (your app's reasoning layer)
- **⚡ Smart Automations** (your app's action layer)

## Genesis vs. Developer API

Understanding the difference between Genesis and our Developer API:

| Feature | Taskade Genesis | Developer API |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| **Target Users** | Business users, non-developers | Developers, technical teams |
| **Creation Method** | Natural language prompts | Code and API calls |
| **App Generation** | ✅ Full app from single prompt | ❌ Manual assembly required |
| **Visual Editor** | ✅ Drag-and-drop interface | ❌ Code-based configuration |
| **Template Library** | ✅ Pre-built app templates | ✅ API-based templates |
| **Custom Integrations** | ❌ Limited to built-in options | ✅ Unlimited via webhooks/API |
| **Programmatic Control** | ❌ GUI-based management | ✅ Full programmatic control |
| **Hosting** | ✅ Automatic Taskade hosting | ✅ Self-hosted or Taskade |
| **Sharing** | ✅ One-click public sharing | ✅ Custom domain integration |
