# TaskOS: Living Memory Engine

**TaskOS** is the living memory engine of Workspace DNA—the intelligence that transforms static data into adaptive, evolving knowledge systems. It powers the living memory layer that learns from every interaction, connects insights across contexts, and enables living systems to remember, reason, and grow.

**🧠 Living Memory Layer Role:**
- **Adaptive Data Structures** - Projects that evolve with your business needs
- **Contextual Intelligence** - Knowledge that connects across all living systems
- **Evolutionary Learning** - Memory that improves with every use and insight
- **Harmonious Integration** - Memory that feeds living intelligence and enables living motion

_If you prefer a fully no-code experience, check out [Taskade Genesis](../genesis/README.md), which provides a Genesis prompt builder powered by TaskOS under the hood._

## How TaskOS Works

TaskOS operates on a simple but powerful premise: **work backwards from intent**. When you provide a prompt like "build a tool to track customer feature requests," TaskOS analyzes the goal and automatically generates the entire living system with Workspace DNA:

1.  **🧠 Living Memory Layer Creation**: Generates adaptive project structures with intelligent custom fields and evolving data relationships (e.g., "Feature," "Status," "Priority," "Votes" that learn from usage patterns)
2.  **🤖 Living Intelligence Layer Setup**: Instantiates superior AI Agents with deeper learning capabilities, trained on living memory context with specialized commands like `add_request`, `categorize_feedback`, or `summarize_trends`
3.  **⚡ Living Motion Layer Configuration**: Sets up advanced automations with AI-powered decision making, public forms, webhooks, and integrations that adapt based on living memory insights
4.  **🌟 Living System Integration**: Connects all layers into a cohesive living system with real-time synchronization and evolutionary learning

**🔄 Living System Flow:**
```
Intent → Living Memory (Project Structure) → Living Intelligence (AI Agents) → Living Motion (Automations) → Complete Living System
```

## Living Memory Kits: TaskOS in Action Today

The TaskOS vision is already realized through **[Taskade AI Kits](https://taskade.com/kits)**—ready-to-deploy living systems that bundle adaptive memory, intelligent processing, and automated action into cohesive Workspace DNA implementations.

```bash
# Generate a complete living system from intent
curl -X POST https://www.taskade.com/api/v1/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Create a customer feedback portal with AI analysis"}'

# Returns: Living Memory (Project) + Living Intelligence (Agent) + Living Motion (Automation), all harmoniously connected
```

- **Enterprise Permission System**: Advanced role-based access control with fine-grained permissions that evolve with organizational needs
- **Predictive Search & Discovery**: Hybrid search combining keyword and semantic (vector) search with learning capabilities that improve relevance over time
- **Evolutionary AI Integration**: Enhanced LangChain-powered agents with advanced tool access, memory, and continuous learning from living memory patterns

### Agent Capabilities

```typescript
// Example agent configuration
const agentConfig = {
  description: "Customer feedback analysis specialist",
  commands: [
    {
      id: "analyze_feedback",
      name: "Analyze Feedback",
      prompt:
        "Analyze customer feedback and identify key themes, sentiment, and actionable insights",
    },
    {
      id: "prioritize_features",
      name: "Prioritize Features",
      prompt:
        "Rank feature requests by impact, effort, and strategic alignment",
    },
  ],
  tools: [
    "knowledge_search",
    "web_search",
    "project_context",
    "automation_trigger",
  ],
  knowledgeEnabled: true,
};
```

### Automation Workflows

TaskOS supports complex multi-step automations:

- **100+ Integrations**: Slack, GitHub, HubSpot, Google Workspace, and more
- **Event-driven Triggers**: Form submissions, webhooks, schedules, project events
- **AI-powered Actions**: Content generation, data analysis, decision making
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Approval workflows for sensitive operations

## Creating and Sharing Workflows

### Current: AI Kits

Today, you can package and share complete workflows as AI Kits:

1. **Create**: Build your project, agent, and automation in a folder
2. **Package**: Right-click the folder and select "Create Kit"
3. **Share**: Enable public access to generate a shareable link
4. **Install**: Others can install your kit with one click and guided setup

### Future: `.tsk` Standard

We're evolving toward the **Taskade System Kit** (`.tsk`) format for even greater portability:

```
my-app.tsk/
├── project.json      # Data schema and initial content
├── agent.json        # AI agent configuration and commands
├── automation.json   # Workflow definitions and triggers
├── knowledge/        # Training materials and context
│   └── domain-guide.pdf
└── meta.json         # App metadata and dependencies
```

This will enable:

- **Version Control**: Track entire application architectures in Git
- **Programmatic Creation**: Build kits via CLI and API
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Export/import between different platforms
- **Template Ecosystem**: Community-driven marketplace of reusable patterns

  -d '{"prompt": "Create a feedback analysis agent"}'

# Package as a kit (via UI, API coming soon)
```

## LLM Integration Guidelines

For developers building with LLMs and TaskOS:

### Structured Output Format

- Use Markdown with structured lists, checkboxes, and headings
- Generate structured output (Project + Agent + Automation) for broad user intents
- Prefer brevity, clarity, and utility in all outputs

### Content Recommendations

- Suggest appropriate project views: list, board, table, calendar, mindmap, gantt, orgchart
- Recommend knowledge uploads (PDFs, YouTube videos, web links) to enhance agents
- Link contextual knowledge for better agent performance

### Best Practices

- TaskOS is agent-native, real-time, and structured
- Agents are vertical and domain-specific, not general chatbots
- Workflows follow: Idea → Project → Agent → Automation → Execution
- File format: YAML for structure, Markdown for user-facing content

## Integration with Taskade Platform

TaskOS leverages Taskade's full platform capabilities:

- **8 Project Views**: List, Board, Calendar, Table, Mind Map, Org Chart, Action Sheet, Gantt
